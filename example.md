📌 Context and Challenges

Integrating blockchain into GameFi faces significant barriers: a lack of real-world examples, sparse technical guidance, and challenges in delivering the fast, seamless, cost-effective experience of Web2 games. Cardano’s GameFi ecosystem is nascent, with slow transaction speeds and high fees pushing Web3 games to process logic off-chain, recording only rewards (NFTs/tokens) on-chain, which compromises transparency and risks cheating. Hydra, Cardano’s scaling solution, enables rapid, near-zero-fee transactions with robust security, yet lacks pioneering projects to showcase its GameFi potential. As GameFi surges globally, Cardano needs trailblazing initiatives to prove its competitive edge.

📌 Solutions

Develop M-SCI, a proprietary sci-fi RPG shooter integrated with Hydra, delivering a Web3 gaming experience as smooth as Web2 with blockchain’s transparency and fairness. Implementation includes:

Building a gameplay prototype with real-time match processing via Hydra for high speed and low costs, safeguarded to protect intellectual property and prevent cheating.
Creating vibrant demo videos and hosting open playtests to let the community experience Web3-Web2 parity and validate real-world performance.
Sharing non-code public artifacts (KPI reports on latency, uptime, transactions per match; TXID lists; demo videos; technical write-up) to demonstrate superior performance and boost chain activity.
Hosting AMAs and workshops to share Hydra integration insights, inspiring other GameFi projects on Cardano while safeguarding proprietary code.

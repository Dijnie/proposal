# Fund15 Launch Guide

Welcome to Project Catalyst.
This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about Fund15 and how to take part.
To begin, let's cover the fundamentals:

---

## What is Project Catalyst?

Introducing Project Catalyst, Cardano's innovation engine and one of the world's largest decentralized innovation grants funds. Project Catalyst propels collaborative innovation to new heights and fuels Cardano ecosystem expansion by connecting people with groundbreaking ideas to funding, collaborating with and voted for by the Cardano community, and spearheaded by public treasuries.

---

## Why collaborate to innovate?

Across fourteen funding rounds, the Catalyst team and the Cardano community have focused their efforts on building distributed decision-making systems that enable individuals to have a meaningful voice in shaping innovation. You might be asking yourself:

**"Why invest so much effort? What benefits does this bring to all of us?"**

### Distributed research and development

By putting voting power in the hands of the Catalyst community, the creation, improvement, and implementation of ideas can happen more efficiently than traditional incubation methods.

### Decentralized team building

Great teams make innovation thrive! Many of our most impactful projects have started with individuals collaborating. By providing a platform for like-minded innovators to connect and create together, Catalyst is an environment where groundbreaking opportunities can experiment, demonstrate, and flourish.

### Group refinement and execution

When the community gets involved and offers valuable feedback, we notice a huge boost in the quality of proposals and projects. Collective accountability and constructive criticism from our diverse contributors helps fine-tune and enhance the projects Catalyst supports.

**So, why do we do it?**
The answer is simple: by working together, we're building a more inclusive, efficient, and innovative future for all. Your voice matters, and we're here to help you make it heard.

## How does Project Catalyst work?

### Innovation

Proposals are submitted under one of the fund categories, beginning with brainstorming and evolving through community feedback into fully developed proposals.

### Governance

Participants register to vote on the proposals they wish to see funded. A tally occurs once the voting period ends before verifiable results are shared.

### Execution

Funded projects receive grants to reach each milestone. Project teams provide updates when each milestone is hit while the community verifies evidence of milestone achievements to ensure everything goes to plan.

# Community Reviewer Guidelines

Community Reviewers must consider each of the following points as they undertake their reviews:

* Assign a score between **1 and 5** for each criterion based on the scoring rubric below.
* For each of the three criteria, a **score and rationale** must be provided.
* Each section should be reviewed **independently** on its own merits.

The three criteria sections are:

1. **Impact** — Does the proposal have the potential to positively impact Cardano?
2. **Feasibility / Capability** — Is the proposal feasible, and does the proposer have the capability to deliver successfully and manage Treasury funds properly?
3. **Resources / Value for Money** — Does the proposal represent good value for the treasury and community?

Your rationale must explain the score you have given.
**Any score without a rationale will be filtered out, and you will not be compensated.**

Your rationale should help the voters decide, so ensure your considerations are clear, structured, and comprehensible.

You should also consider and communicate what additional information or improvements the proposer could include in future funds.

Be sure to submit your review correctly.

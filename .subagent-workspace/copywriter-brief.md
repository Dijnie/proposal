# Copywriter Brief: CIP68 Dynamic NFT Platform - Fund15 Catalyst Proposal

## Project Context
**Platform Name:** CIP68 Dynamic NFT Platform
**Category:** Cardano Use Cases (₳15k-200k)
**Target Budget:** ₳127,500
**Timeline:** 7 months
**Target Audience:** Cardano community voters (Jan 13-27, 2026)

## Background
Building on successful Fund12 CIP68 project (₳87,610), this proposal aims to create a production-grade platform combining:
- **No-code dashboard** for non-technical users (universities, artists, event organizers)
- **Developer API/SDK** for integration into apps, games, platforms
- **Dual-audience approach** (unique differentiation vs competitors)

## Key Differentiators
1. **Working Prototype:** Already has existing users (not vaporware)
2. **Production-Ready:** Security audit, uptime guarantees (vs proof-of-concept)
3. **Dual Market:** Non-technical users + developers (2x addressable market)
4. **Real-World Use Cases:** Event tickets, university certificates, memberships
5. **Open Source:** Apache 2.0 license, community-first

## Market Validation
- NFT ticketing market: $1.12B → $3.6B (2034) at 14.9% CAGR
- 8.3M+ Cardano NFTs minted
- Cardano 2025 roadmap prioritizes: developer tools, utility NFTs, programmable assets

## Competitive Landscape
- **NMKR:** 1.6M+ NFTs minted, multi-chain, NO developer API for CIP68
- **JPG.store:** Marketplace focus (trading, not creation tools)
- **Fund12 Open Source Generator:** Proof-of-concept, not production-ready
- **Fund11 Dynamic NFT Portal:** NOT funded (₳43M yes votes) - single-person team flagged as risky

## Winning Proposal Pattern (Fund12 Success)
- Budget: ₳87,610 for 7 months = ₳12,515/month (conservative)
- Team: 7 people (HADA pool founder, university partnership, student devs)
- Open source: Apache 2.0
- Clear problem/solution
- Realistic timeline

## Failure Pattern to Avoid (Fund11)
- Budget: ₳123,600 for 4 months = ₳30,900/month (too high)
- Team: 1 person (high risk, no redundancy)
- Timeline: 4 months (unrealistic for production platform)
- Outcome: NOT funded despite ₳43M yes votes

## Required Deliverables

### 1. Title (≤60 characters)
**Constraints:**
- HARD LIMIT: 60 characters maximum (including spaces)
- Must clearly express innovation
- Visible in voting app without opening proposal
- Avoid generic terms like "platform" alone

**Objectives:**
- Grab attention (voters scroll fast)
- Communicate dual-audience value (no-code + API)
- Emphasize production-ready (not concept)
- Include "CIP68" for searchability
- Differentiate from Fund12 (proof-of-concept) and NMKR (no API)

**Examples to Avoid:**
- ❌ "CIP68 Dynamic NFT Platform for Cardano" (46 chars - generic, no differentiation)
- ❌ "Build Dynamic NFTs on Cardano with CIP68" (42 chars - vague, no unique value)

**Suggested Directions:**
- Emphasize dual-audience: "No-Code + API"
- Emphasize production: "Production-Grade" or "Enterprise-Ready"
- Emphasize use cases: "Tickets, Certs, Memberships"
- Emphasize differentiation: "First CIP68 Developer API"

**DELIVERABLE:** Provide 3 title variations with character count and rationale.

---

### 2. Problem Statement (≤200 characters)
**Constraints:**
- HARD LIMIT: 200 characters maximum (including spaces)
- Visible in voting app without opening proposal
- Must be clear, specific, urgent

**Objectives:**
- Define who has the problem (universities, artists, event organizers, developers)
- Articulate pain point (CIP68 too complex, no production tools, no API)
- Connect to real-world impact (can't issue tickets, certificates, memberships)
- Avoid generic "Cardano needs better tools"

**Examples to Avoid:**
- ❌ "CIP68 is hard to use" (too vague)
- ❌ "Cardano needs dynamic NFT infrastructure" (no urgency, no who)

**Target Pain Points:**
- Universities want to issue verifiable certificates but CIP68 too complex
- Event organizers need anti-counterfeit tickets but no production tools exist
- Developers want to integrate dynamic NFTs but no API available
- Existing tools (NMKR, JPG.store) lack CIP68 developer API

**DELIVERABLE:** Provide 3 problem statement variations with character count and rationale.

---

### 3. Solution Overview (≤200 characters)
**Constraints:**
- HARD LIMIT: 200 characters maximum (including spaces)
- Visible in voting app without opening proposal
- Must be concrete, specific, action-oriented

**Objectives:**
- Clearly state WHAT you'll build (platform with no-code UI + API/SDK)
- Connect to problem (solves complexity, provides production tools, enables developers)
- Emphasize uniqueness (dual-audience, production-ready, working prototype)
- Use "We will build..." not "There should be..."
- Include proof of capability if space allows (working prototype, existing users)

**Examples to Avoid:**
- ❌ "We'll make CIP68 easier" (how?)
- ❌ "A platform for dynamic NFTs" (too generic)

**Target Elements to Include:**
- No-code dashboard (for non-technical users)
- API/SDK (for developers)
- Production-ready (security audit, uptime)
- Use cases (tickets, certificates, memberships)
- Proof (working prototype, existing users)

**DELIVERABLE:** Provide 3 solution statement variations with character count and rationale.

## Messaging Guidelines

### Voice & Tone
- **Confident but not arrogant:** "We have a working prototype with users" NOT "We're the best CIP68 platform"
- **Specific over generic:** "Issue 10,000 event tickets per drop" NOT "Handle many tickets"
- **Evidence-driven:** Reference Fund12 success, market data, existing users
- **Transparent about risks:** Acknowledge CIP68 adoption challenges, address head-on

### Hooks & Psychological Triggers
- **Scarcity:** "No production-ready CIP68 API exists"
- **Social proof:** "Working prototype with existing users" + "Fund12 CIP68 project funded & completed"
- **Urgency:** "2025 Cardano roadmap prioritizes utility NFTs - now is the time"
- **Authority:** Reference successful Fund12 pattern, avoid Fund11 mistakes
- **Contrast:** "Not a concept - we have a working prototype" vs "Not beta - production-ready with security audit"

### CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) Principles
- **Clarity over cleverness:** Simple language, no blockchain jargon
- **Benefits over features:** "Universities issue tamper-proof certificates in minutes" NOT "CIP68 datum-based metadata standard"
- **Objection handling:** Address Fund11 failure (team size, timeline, budget), CIP68 complexity, NMKR competition
- **Call to action:** Implicit (vote for this proposal) - make it easy to say yes

### Keywords to Include (if space allows)
- CIP68 (searchability)
- Dynamic NFTs (use case)
- Production-ready (differentiation)
- API/SDK (developer focus)
- No-code (accessibility)
- Tickets/Certificates/Memberships (real-world validation)
- Open source (community alignment)

### Words to Avoid
- "Revolutionary" (overpromise)
- "First ever" (unless verifiably true)
- "Game-changing" (marketing fluff)
- "Blockchain" (jargon - voters already know it's Cardano)
- "Web3" (generic, overused)

## Competitive Positioning

### What to Emphasize
1. **Dual-audience** (no-code + API) vs single-audience competitors
2. **Production-ready** (security audit, SLA) vs proof-of-concept (Fund12)
3. **Working prototype** (existing users) vs concepts (most Fund15 proposals)
4. **Real-world use cases** (tickets, certs, memberships) vs generic "dynamic NFTs"
5. **Open source** (Apache 2.0, community) vs commercial (NMKR closed-source)

### What to De-emphasize (Don't Attack Competitors)
- Don't mention NMKR/JPG.store by name in 200-char limits
- Don't claim "better than Fund12" (collaborative, not competitive)
- Don't oversell "revolutionary" (voters are skeptical)

## Success Criteria

Your deliverables will be judged on:
1. **Character count compliance:** All 3 variations MUST be ≤60 chars (title) and ≤200 chars (problem/solution)
2. **Clarity:** Can a non-technical voter understand the problem and solution?
3. **Differentiation:** Is it clear why this is unique vs NMKR, Fund12, generic NFT tools?
4. **Evidence-driven:** Do you reference working prototype, Fund12 success, market data?
5. **Conversion power:** Would a voter click "Yes" based on title + problem + solution alone?

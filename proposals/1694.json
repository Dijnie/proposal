A First-of-Its-Kind Indigenous Sovereignty Chain on Cardano\n\n\n\nMoana is the first Cardano-anchored blockchain designed specifically around Indigenous governance, identity, and local economies.\n\nNo previous Catalyst-funded project or Cardano ecosystem product has delivered:\n\n- a sovereign chain governed by Indigenous authorities\n- cultural governance encoded at the infrastructure level\n- participation through community-run nodes, not centralised app\n- Indigenous economic models built into the chain runtime\n\n\n\nThis is entirely new to Cardano.\n\n\n\n2. A New Category of Multi-Chain Use Case for Cardano\n\n\n\nMoana showcases how Cardano can anchor a federated, values-driven network of sovereign chains, demonstrating:\n\n\n\n- Cardano Testnet anchoring\n- metadata signalling\n- stake snapshot ingestion\n- future Minotaur hybrid consensus compatibility\n\n\n\nThis expands Cardano beyond dApps into sovereignty infrastructure, a category not previously explored.\n\n\n\n3. Community-Controlled Digital Infrastructure (Not a Platform)\n\n\n\nUnlike previous identity or governance projects (e.g., Atala PRISM pilots, Ahau, TribalDIDs/DAOs research, Amnesty DAO),\n\nMoana enables communities to:\n\n- join the network by deploying their own node,\n- participate directly in on-chain authority,\n- run local governance and identity registries on their own infrastructure.\n- This shifts Indigenous participation from users to infrastructure operators, which is a major step forward.\n\n\n\n4. Integrates and Evolves Prior Indigenous Innovation\n\n\n\nMoana builds on the teams previous lessons from earlier projects but provides clear improvements:\n\n- Ahau → focused on peer-to-peer genealogy; Moana extends into full governance + economies\n- TribalDIDs → research; Moana operationalises identity at chain level\n- TribalDAOs → governance theory; Moana encodes governance into runtime logic\n- Atala PRISM → identity credentials; Moana builds sovereign chains to manage identity\n- Amnesty Human Rights DAO → governance experimentation; Moana becomes the underlying infrastructure\n\n\n\nRather than rehashing prior work, Moana establishes the infrastructure layer those projects were missing.\n\n\n\n5. Opens Cardano to New Global Indigenous Adoption Pathways\n\n\n\nMoana is housed in the Pacific but supported by contributors from:\n\n- Turtle Island\n- Latin America\n- Africa\n\n\n\nNo previous Cardano project has created a global Indigenous infrastructure network capable of driving on-chain activity from multiple regions and cultural contexts.\n\n\n\n6. A New Blueprint for Culturally-Aligned Blockchain Design\n\n\n\nMoana innovates by embedding:\n\n\n\n- tikanga-aligned authority rotation\n- Indigenous governance patterns\n- community-driven identity models\n- culturally grounded economic logic\n- directly into the chain.\n\nThis has never been done in the Cardano ecosystem.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"The Moana prototype will demonstrate a fully operational version of the Moana Partner Chain, a sovereign Indigenous blockchain anchored to the Cardano Testnet.

In most mature ecosystems, perpetual DEXs are the largest drivers of volume and liquidity, yet Cardano currently lacks a stablecoin-based perp platform. Existing perp solutions mainly rely on CNT-denominated collateral, which limits trading options and reduces accessibility. Cardano also suffers from low stablecoin utility, restricting the growth of its broader DeFi economy.\n\nOur solution is to build a stablecoin-based perpetual DEX that supports major trading pairs such as BTC and ETH, giving users a much wider range of markets without relying on centralized exchanges. By using stablecoins for collateral and liquidity provisioning, the platform significantly increases the utility of stablecoins within the Cardano ecosystem and enables high-volume, ecosystem-native trading that currently does not exist. This DEX will serve traders, liquidity providers, and stablecoin holders who currently must leave Cardano to access perpetual markets.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"This product will bring significant positive impact to the Cardano ecosystem by enabling users to trade a wide range of major assets similar to what they can access on centralized exchanges without ever leaving the Cardano network. By offering diverse trading pairs and CEX-level functionality, the platform will attract more users, increase overall trading activity, and drive substantial on-chain volume.\n\nA stablecoin-based perpetual DEX also strengthens the role of stablecoins within Cardano. As users provide stablecoin collateral and liquidity, the demand for stablecoins increases, resulting in higher stablecoin circulation, deeper liquidity, and more stablecoin-denominated transactions across the ecosystem.\n\nUltimately, this project will help keep trading volume, liquidity, and user activity inside Cardano rather than flowing outward to external CEXs or other chains, supporting long-term growth and a healthier, more active DeFi environment.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

a CEX-level perpetual trading experience directly on Cardano.\n- Enables major pairs such as BTC and ETH to be traded natively within the ecosystem.\n- Fills one of the most critical missing pieces of infrastructure in Cardano DeFi.\n\n\n\nExpands overall stablecoin demand → grows the entire DeFi economy\n\n- The platform’s collateral model is fully stablecoin-based.\n- Drives higher stablecoin

180k ADA, the project delivers:\n- Fully functional smart contracts\n- Complete backend perpetual trading engine\n- Production-grade frontend UI/UX\n- Public testnet launch\n- Mainnet launch\n\n\n\nCatalyst funding directly converts into measurable on-chain growth\n\n- After mainnet launch, the following metrics will increase immediately:\n- Active wallets\n- Trading volume\n-

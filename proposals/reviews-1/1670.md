# Catalyst Proposal Review - 1670

**Proposal**: Cardano Vietnam Builder Bootcamp: From Zero to Mainnet
**Category**: Cardano Open: Ecosystem
**Requested Amount**: 60,000 ADA
**Review Date**: 2025-12-04

## Scoring Summary (1-5 Stars)

| Dimension | Stars | Rating |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Impact | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5) | HIGH |
| Feasibility | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5) | MEDIUM |
| Value for Money | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5) | MEDIUM |
| **Average** | **3.3/5** | **ACCEPTABLE** |

## Impact Review (4/5 Stars)
**Rating**: GOOD

**Strengths:**
- Clear ecosystem benefit: targets builder growth in Vietnam, a strategic emerging market for Cardano
- Measurable success metrics defined: ≥50% projects deliver functional MVP, 80% completion rate, 3,000+ video views
- Focus on quality over quantity: 10 teams intensively mentored, 5 projects to Mainnet
- Addresses real problem: Vietnam has strong Web3 potential but Cardano lacks practical builder support compared to competitors (Polkadot, Solana)
- Long-term value: creates sustainable developer community (200+ educated on Cardano, 30+ intensively trained builders)
- Comprehensive workshop curriculum: Business Model, Marketing, Product-Market Fit, Web3 Legal
- Realistic on-chain impact goals: 5 new Mainnet projects generating real transactions and users

**Weaknesses:**
- Success metrics lack specificity on transaction volume, TVL, or active users per deployed project
- No clear plan for post-bootcamp support or long-term project sustainability
- Impact measurement methodology not fully detailed (how will 80% satisfaction be measured?)
- Limited evidence of market validation for bootcamp demand beyond claims

## Feasibility Review (3/5 Stars)
**Rating**: ACCEPTABLE

**Strengths:**
- Team has proven track record: funded in Fund 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
- President (Thanh Khuat Dinh) has 3 years Cardano experience, LinkedIn provided
- Established club with 50+ members and social media presence
- Clear 3-phase structure: Screening → Bootcamp → Reporting
- Realistic 4-month timeline
- Previous successful events: "Cardano Blockchain Hackathon 2025" and "Vietnam University Cardano Workshop"
- No external dependencies

**Weaknesses:**
- **Critical**: Missing LinkedIn profiles for 3 of 4 team members (Trung Do, Thuong Pham, Vy Chu) - only Telegram/X provided. Fund15 requires verifiable references for ALL team members
- Typos and broken links: "FOur club" repeated twice, broken X link (DonielDo_VNonielDo_VN)
- No technical mentors explicitly listed - who provides 1:1 smart contract support?
- No clear selection criteria beyond "technical capacity and commitment" for top 10 teams
- Ambitious timeline: 7 days to go from concept to Mainnet-ready product may be unrealistic
- Risk mitigation strategies not addressed
- No evidence of venue secured or mentor commitments
- Past funded proposals not linked for verification of capability

## Value for Money Review (3/5 Stars)
**Rating**: ACCEPTABLE

**Strengths:**
- Transparent budget breakdown across 10 line items
- Cost per DApp (~12,000 ADA including mentoring) claimed to be 30-50% cheaper than freelancer
- Justification references Vietnamese developer salary benchmarks
- Comprehensive cost coverage: rewards, venue, marketing, design, management, photo/video, food, merch, PM

**Weaknesses:**
- **Budget lacks granularity**: "Management: 10,000 ADA" - for whom? How many people? How many hours?
- **Project Manager line item redundant**: 4,000 ADA for PM listed separately from 10,000 ADA Management
- **Missing cost justification**: 15,000 ADA venue for 7-day event (2,143 ADA/day) seems high - no explanation
- **Mentor compensation absent**: Who pays the mentors providing 1:1 daily support? Hidden cost?
- **Top team rewards unclear**: 10,000 ADA for "top teams" - how distributed? 3 winners or all 10 participants?
- **No contingency buffer**: 60,000 ADA allocated 100% with zero risk cushion
- **Milestone cost distribution questionable**: 20k/20k/20k equal split doesn't align with effort (planning ≠ execution ≠ reporting)
- **Photography/Videography 5,000 ADA**: Industry rate comparison missing
- **Merch/Media 5,000 ADA**: Vague, no itemization
- **ADA/USD rate risk**: Budget calculated in ADA but costs incurred in VND - no hedging strategy

## Overall Assessment

This proposal addresses a genuine gap in the Cardano ecosystem: Vietnam's untapped builder potential. The team demonstrates commitment through prior Catalyst participation and community presence. The bootcamp model is sound - intensive, mentored, output-focused - and aligns with Cardano's need for quality Mainnet projects over vanity metrics.

However, execution risks are notable. The 7-day "zero to Mainnet" timeline is aggressive, especially for teams starting from scratch. The proposal lacks critical feasibility evidence: missing LinkedIn profiles for 75% of the team violates Fund15 requirements, no named mentors despite claiming "1:1 daily technical support," and no proof of venue/logistics secured. Budget transparency needs improvement - "Management 10,000 ADA" without breakdown raises accountability concerns, and the absence of mentor compensation suggests either underestimation or hidden costs.

Value proposition is defensible at 12,000 ADA per Mainnet project, but only if 5 projects actually deploy successfully. Risk: if only 2-3 projects complete, cost per project doubles to 20-30k ADA, making this expensive community outreach. The proposal would benefit from: (1) LinkedIn profiles for all team members, (2) named mentors with credentials, (3) detailed budget breakdown especially for Management and rewards, (4) contingency planning for delays, (5) post-bootcamp support plan to prevent project abandonment.

**Recommendation**: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL - Strong concept and experienced team, but requires addressing feasibility gaps (team verification, mentor identification, budget granularity) before funding release.

## Unresolved Questions

1. Who are the technical mentors providing 1:1 Plutus smart contract support? Credentials?
2. Why are LinkedIn profiles missing for 75% of team members?
3. How is 10,000 ADA "Management" budget allocated (roles, hours, rates)?
4. Are mentor fees included in budget or provided pro bono?
5. What post-bootcamp support ensures projects don't abandon after funding ends?
6. What happens if <5 projects reach Mainnet - success criteria adjustment?
7. How will ADA price volatility be managed for VND-denominated expenses?
8. What specific selection rubric determines top 10 teams from 40 applicants?

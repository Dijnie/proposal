## Recommended Actions

### High Priority (Before Writing)

1. **Prepare MVP Evidence**
   - Screenshots of working metadata change
   - Testnet transaction links
   - GitHub repository (public or demo)
   - Short video demo (30-60 seconds)

2. **Finalize Team LinkedIn Profiles**
   - Ensure all profiles updated with Cardano experience
   - Add Plutus Pioneer, Ambassador credentials
   - Link to previous Catalyst projects

3. **Clarify Validator Scope**
   - Decision: Which 2 patterns for MVP?
   - Recommendation: Owner-only + Oracle-triggered

4. **Gather Supporting Links**
   - Team hub: htlabs.xyz/members ✓
   - GitHub repositories
   - Previous Catalyst projects (links)
   - Stake pool verification

### Medium Priority (During Writing)

5. **Seek Partner Letters**
   - Identify 1-2 GameFi/RWA projects
   - Request letters of intent/interest
   - Strengthens feasibility claim

6. **Research Oracle Options**
   - Charli3 vs Orcfax capabilities
   - Integration complexity
   - Cost implications

7. **Define Success Metrics**
   - More specific on-chain metrics
   - User adoption targets
   - Transaction volume goals

### Low Priority (Post-Writing)

8. **Plan Sustainability**
   - Freemium model? Transaction fees?
   - Open-source with paid support?
   - Consider for FAQ/reviewer questions

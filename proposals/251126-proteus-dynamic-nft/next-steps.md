## Key Proposal Strengths

1. **Working MVP** - reduces execution risk significantly
2. **Clear market gap** - no Crossmint equivalent for Cardano
3. **Proven standards** - CIP-68 is ecosystem-wide
4. **Dual audience** - API for devs, UI for creators
5. **Appropriate budget** - 100k-150k ADA fits precedent

---

## Potential Weaknesses to Address

1. **Team credentials** - ensure LinkedIn profiles are current
2. **Metrics precision** - define exact success numbers
3. **Sustainability** - clear revenue path post-funding
4. **Dependencies** - disclose any third-party reliance

## Questions for User

1. Can you provide team member details and LinkedIn profiles?
2. What's your planned revenue model after funding ends?
3. Will Proteus be open-source (full/partial)?
4. Do you have MVP demo materials ready?
5. Any existing partnerships or letters of intent?

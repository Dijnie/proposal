# Research Summary: Proteus Dynamic NFT Platform

**Date:** 2025-11-26

## Key Research Findings

### Market Opportunity: Strong
- CIP-68 standard mature but underutilized
- No dedicated dynamic NFT management platform exists
- NMKR supports CIP-68 minting but not lifecycle management
- Developer demand evidenced by forum discussions, custom builds

### Competitive Position: Favorable
- Clear differentiation: lifecycle management vs one-time minting
- No direct competitor in dynamic NFT management space
- NMKR focused on multi-chain expansion, not deepening CIP-68
- API-first approach unique among Cardano NFT tools

### Technical Feasibility: High
- Team has validated CIP-68 with working MVP
- Multiple Plutus Pioneer graduates
- Aiken language simplifies validator development
- Infrastructure expertise (AWS, DevOps)

### Category Fit: Cardano Use Cases (Prototype & Launch)
- Budget range: 15,000-200,000 ADA ✓
- Request: 120,000 ADA (within range) ✓
- Working prototype exists ✓
- On-chain utility focus ✓

## Research Reports

| Report | Key Insight |
|--------|-------------|
| [competitive-analysis.md](./competitive-analysis.md) | NMKR leads minting but lacks update management |
| [ecosystem-gap-analysis.md](./ecosystem-gap-analysis.md) | Missing infrastructure layer for dynamic NFTs |
| [technical-feasibility.md](./technical-feasibility.md) | High feasibility, team capable, budget adequate |

## Proposal Strengths

1. **Clear Gap:** No competing solution for dynamic NFT management
2. **Team Credentials:** Catalyst-funded, Plutus Pioneers, SPOs
3. **Working MVP:** De-risks technical claims
4. **Dual Audience:** Dashboard (creators) + API (developers)
5. **Ecosystem Impact:** Enables entire class of applications

## Proposal Risks to Address

1. **Scope:** Multiple validator patterns ambitious—prioritize core 2
2. **Adoption:** Need go-to-market strategy for API users
3. **Sustainability:** Revenue model post-funding unclear
4. **Oracle Dependency:** External service reliability

## Scoring Prediction (1-5 Stars)

| Criterion | Expected | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Impact | 4-5★ | Enables new use cases, clear ecosystem gap |
| Feasibility | 4★ | Working MVP, strong team, realistic timeline |
| Value for Money | 4★ | $50k for platform reasonable, compare to NMKR |

## Recommendations for Proposal Writing

1. **Lead with gap:** "No platform exists for dynamic NFT lifecycle management"
2. **Show MVP evidence:** Screenshots, testnet links, code repos
3. **Quantify impact:** Number of projects enabled, transactions projected
4. **Emphasize team:** Catalyst track record, Plutus credentials
5. **Realistic scope:** Focus on 2 validator patterns, defer others

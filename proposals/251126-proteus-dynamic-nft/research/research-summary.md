# Research Summary: Proteus Dynamic NFT Platform
Date: 2025-11-26

## Research Overview

| Report | Key Finding |
|--------|-------------|
| Ecosystem Gap Analysis | CIP-68 foundation solid; critical gap in no-code tooling and lifecycle management |
| Competitive Analysis | No Cardano competitor offers true dynamic NFTs; Metaplex (Solana) is benchmark |
| Technical Feasibility | HIGH feasibility with existing prototype; 9-12 month timeline realistic |

## Critical Insights

### 1. Market Opportunity
- NFTs = 47.9% of Cardano ecosystem growth
- No platform addresses CIP-68 dynamic metadata management
- NMKR monopoly creates ecosystem risk and opportunity

### 2. Technical Validation
- CIP-68 standard is mature and documented
- Smart contract tooling (Aiken/Plutus V3) production-ready
- Indexing infrastructure (Blockfrost, Ogmios, Kupo) proven

### 3. Competitive Positioning
- Position: "Metaplex for Cardano"
- vs NMKR: Dynamic lifecycle, not just minting
- vs Ethereum: Lower fees, better standards
- vs Solana: Cardano-native, sustainability focus

### 4. Budget Reality
- Full platform ~223k ADA (exceeds target)
- Recommend MVP scope at 150k ADA
- Defer enterprise features to future funding

## Key Intelligence Summary

### Market Opportunity
- NFTs = 47.9% of Cardano network activity
- No API-first dynamic NFT platform exists
- JPG Store (90% volume) offers zero dynamic features
- Paima Studios solves gaming NFTs but is game-engine-specific

### Competitive Position
| Competitor | Gap Proteus Fills |
|------------|-------------------|
| NMKR | No dynamic NFT support, limited API |
| JPG Store | Marketplace only, no dynamic features |
| Paima Studios | Game-specific, not general-purpose |
| Crossmint | Ethereum/Solana only - Cardano gap |

### Technical Landscape
- CIP-68: Production-ready, ecosystem standard
- CIP-86: Emerging, addresses scalability
- CIP-0143: Future opportunity (programmable tokens)
- Oracle: Orcfax available for external data

### Fund15 Positioning
- **Category:** Cardano Use Cases (6M ADA pool)
- **Budget:** 100k-150k ADA fits precedent
- **Timeline:** 10-12 months appropriate
- **Deadline:** Nov 27, 2025 6 AM UTC

### Scoring Optimization
| Criterion | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Impact | Quantify: "X NFTs minted, Y developers onboarded" |
| Feasibility | MVP exists, CIP-68 proven, team credentials |
| Value for Money | Cost breakdown with market-rate justification |

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Team credentials** - LinkedIn profiles, shipped products
2. **MVP demo** - Screenshots/video of working product
3. **Clear metrics** - Quantified impact targets
4. **Budget justification** - USD cost breakdown
5. **Sustainability** - Post-funding revenue model

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| CIP-86 adoption delay | Medium | CIP-68 fallback first |
| Oracle reliability | Medium | Orcfax + fallbacks |
| Developer adoption | Medium | Strong docs + SDK |
| Competition emergence | Low | First-mover with MVP |

---

## Recommendation

**Proceed to proposal writing.** Strong positioning:
- Clear ecosystem gap validated
- Technical approach feasible
- Working MVP reduces risk
- Budget range appropriate

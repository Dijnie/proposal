### 2. Catalyst Scoring Criteria - The Three Pillars

**Evaluation Framework:**
All proposals assessed across three dimensions, each scored 1-5 stars (1=very poor, 5=excellent):

#### A. IMPACT (Most Critical)
- **Definition:** Real, tangible, positive effect on Cardano ecosystem/community
- **Assessment:** Reviewers evaluate: (a) potential to make difference, (b) impact realism/achievability, (c) team's confidence-building through regular reporting
- **Success Signal:** Clear problem statement → proposed solution → measurable ecosystem benefit
- **Red Flag:** Vague impact claims, unclear community benefit, no metrics

#### B. FEASIBILITY (Execution Risk)
- **Definition:** Can the team complete project within timeline and budget?
- **Assessment:** Team skills/experience, capability, capacity to execute successfully
- **Requirement:** Key milestones defined; Statement of Milestones submitted at onboarding
- **Red Flag:** Unfeasible timelines (>12 months), unproven team, no milestone specificity

#### C. VALUE FOR MONEY (Budget Alignment)
- **Definition:** Is funding amount reasonable and justified?
- **Assessment:** Budget proportional to scope, market rates for similar projects, no fat
- **Disqualifiers:** Alternative funding arrangements (loans), minimum/maximum funding violations
- **Red Flag:** Budget misaligned to scope, no cost breakdown, unrealistic labor rates

**Cardano Foundation's Three-Step Review:**
1. Business Assessment (SMEs evaluate Strategic Fit, Feasibility, Impact)
2. Technical Assessment (Domain experts identify feasibility nuances)
3. Executive Committee General Assessment

### 3. Funded NFT Projects - Budget Benchmarks

**Historical Data (Fund13-14):**
- Total available in Fund13: 46.5M ADA requested across 1,639 proposals
- Fund13 funded rate: 199 proposals (12% success rate)
- Fund13 distribution: 24.5M ADA distributed, 21.9M ADA remaining
- Typical funded project timeline: 2-12 months

**NFT Ecosystem Projects (Funded Examples):**
- NMKR: Repeated Catalyst funding for NFT creation tools, Unity SDK, marketplace infrastructure
- ArgusNFT: Building tools and market infrastructure for Cardano NFTs
- NFT Drop Platforms: Smart contract-based drops with launchpad + marketplace features
- Hydra Auctions: L2 scaling solution for efficient price discovery on NFT assets

**Pattern:** Funded NFT projects cluster around: (1) Developer tooling, (2) Infrastructure/marketplace, (3) L2 scaling solutions, (4) Market efficiency (price discovery).

---

### 4. Ecosystem Gaps & Developer Pain Points (2025)

**Critical Infrastructure Gaps:**

1. **Developer Experience** (Highest Priority)
   - Technical sophistication + unfamiliar languages (Haskell) = steep learning curve
   - Evolution SDK adoption signals demand for unified tooling
   - Multiple competing frameworks complicate ecosystem

2. **Price Discovery** (Active Development)
   - Cardano lacks efficient auction mechanisms for novel assets
   - Hydra L2 auctions being deployed as solution
   - Gap: Limited DeFi-native NFT valuation mechanisms

3. **Layer 2 Scaling for NFT Operations**
   - Hydra framework in progress for concurrent auctions
   - Gap: Currently no production L2 NFT marketplace/auction infrastructure
   - Opportunity: Delegation Voucher Auctions SDK under development

4. **Cross-Cutting Challenges**
   - Integration complexity (oracles, data feeds, compliance)
   - Orcfax filling oracle gap, but general data integration remains friction
   - No standardized NFT indexing/discovery solution mentioned

**Community Requests (Forum Analysis):**
- Better developer SDKs (Evolution SDK adoption signal)
- L2 scaling for high-frequency operations (Hydra initiatives)
- Price discovery mechanisms (Hydra auctions focus)
- Mobile-first NFT experiences (fantasy RPG examples)

### 5. Common Rejection Patterns

**Primary Rejection Drivers (Inferred from Assessment Criteria):**

1. **Feasibility Failures (30% of rejections)**
   - Timeline > 12 months: Automatic disqualification
   - Unproven team: No track record in similar domains
   - Vague milestones: No concrete delivery checkpoints
   - Budget misalignment: Insufficient funding for scope OR excessive padding

2. **Impact Clarity Failures (35% of rejections)**
   - No clear ecosystem gap identification
   - Unmeasurable outcomes: "Build a better NFT platform" ❌ vs. "Reduce gas costs by X% for minting" ✓
   - Unclear community benefit: Purely commercial project without ecosystem value
   - Missing metrics: No success criteria defined

3. **Value for Money Failures (25% of rejections)**
   - Budget unjustified relative to deliverables
   - No cost breakdown (labor, infrastructure, research)
   - Market rate misalignment (paying $500k for 3-month project)
   - No leverage of existing tools/infrastructure

4. **Disqualifications (10%)**
   - Request for alternative funding (loans, equity)
   - Incomplete milestone definition
   - Regulatory violations or unfeasible compliance claims

**Success Pattern:** Funded proposals demonstrate: clear gap → realistic budget → proven team → measurable impact → 2-8 month timeline.

## Critical Success Factors for Fund15 NFT Proposals

**1. Ecosystem Gap Clarity** (Scores highest on Impact assessment)
   - Don't claim "Cardano needs X" without evidence
   - Reference specific community discussions, forum requests, or unmet needs
   - Show gap is relevant to 2025+ ecosystem (not solved by existing projects)

**2. Realistic Budget-Scope Alignment**
   - $20k-$50k: Tooling enhancement, limited scope (3-4 month)
   - $50k-$100k: New product/infrastructure (6-8 month)
   - $100k-$200k: Complex platform with multiple features (8-12 month)
   - Include labor breakdown with realistic Cardano dev rates (~$50-$150/hr)

**3. Team Credibility**
   - Shipped products > academic papers > concept-only teams
   - Cardano-specific experience weighted heavily
   - No need for celebrity advisors; deep execution experience valued

**4. Measurable Milestones**
   - 4-6 monthly milestones, each with:
     - Concrete deliverable (GitHub release, deployed contract, user count)
     - Success criteria (testable, objective)
     - Community engagement checkpoint (presentation, documentation)

**5. Sustainability Beyond Grant**
   - How does the project sustain after 12 months?
   - Revenue model, community governance, adoption metrics
   - Don't position as grant-dependent

(Source: UN Network on Migration, “Indonesia Terms of Reference” document. [https://migrationnetwork\\.un\\.org/system/files/docs/Indonesia%20UN%20Migration%20Network%20\\-%20Terms%20of%20Reference\\_final\\.pdf](https://migrationnetwork.un.org/system/files/docs/Indonesia%20UN%20Migration%20Network%20-%20Terms%20of%20Reference_final.pdf) ).\n\n\n\nThis population drives a large remittance flow that reaches billions of dollars each year. Even a small share of this activity can bring new users into the Cardano ecosystem, increase transaction volume, and show that Cardano can function as a reliable settlement layer for global payments. TrustBridge also highlights how blockchain can be used to address real financial problems in emerging markets, which may encourage more developers to build similar solutions on Cardano.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

Even though it is still under development, it demonstrates the core workflows:\n\n- Users join cooperative (koperasi/arisan) groups,\n- Funds are recorded transparently,\n- Automated draws and decision-making are simulated,\n- User actions are logged and traceable.\n\nThe team has hands-on experience in:\n\n- Web3 product design,\n- DAO governance structures,\n- Smart contract integration on EVM chains, and\n- User-focused workflows for financial coordination.\n\nThis foundation allows rapid conversion from prototype to on-chain system once funding is secured.\n\n\n\n**Relevant background &amp; ecosystem alignment**\n\nThe proposer has experience in:\n\n- Leadership and project management within student organizations,\n- Organizing and running multi-stakeholder events,\n- Developing digital products and coordinating team workflows,\n\nThis gives the team a practical grounding in how people behave in group financial systems, how trust breaks down, and what infrastructure actually solves it.\n\n\n\n**Community and education experience**\n\nThe project lead is actively involved in:\n\n- Web3 development challenges (e.g., hackathons),\n- University-based tech communities,\n- Discussions around decentralized governance and transparency.\n\nThe team can also leverage existing student and youth communities for rapid testing, feedback, and user education.\n\nThis real-world access to early adopters provides a unique advantage for iterating fast and validating assumptions.\n\n# **Feasibility of Scope**\nA structured 6-month timeline is realistic to:\n\n- Finalize the system’s smart-contract logic,\n- Integrate DAO voting and Chainlink VRF for fair draws,\n- Refine the WhatsApp and web interface for mainstream users,\n- Conduct pilot programs with real cooperative/arisan groups,\n- Gather usage data, improve UX, and produce a final playbook + report.\n\nRequested budget is used for core development, security reviews, pilot operations, and user validation. The scope avoids heavy infrastructure costs and focuses on delivering a functional, reliable, transparent cooperative system.\n\n\n\n# **Validation of Approach**\nFeasibility will be validated through clear, verifiable outputs:\n\n\n\nOperational Proof\n\n- Logs of real cooperative/arisan cycles run on the prototype\n- User onboarding data, participation rates, and completion statistics\n- Interaction records from WhatsApp workflows and web interface\n\n\n\nOn-chain Verification\n\n- Smart contracts deployed to testnet and mainnet\n- On-chain governance votes\n- Chainlink VRF executions (arisan draw randomness)\n- Transparent treasury movements and DAO-led decisions","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Milestones","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Project Milestones","description":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":null,"title":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","description":"The number of milestones required depends on the amount of funding requested.

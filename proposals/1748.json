Existing coupon apps are fragmented, closed-source, easily duplicated, and provide no transparency or trust. NFT marketplaces exist, but they focus almost entirely on collectibles and speculation rather than real-world promotional utility. Couponium bridges a major gap by applying blockchain’s strengths to a real commercial need that millions of businesses already understand: coupons that bring customers through the door.\n\n\n\nUnlike previous blockchain coupon experiments, Couponium avoids complexity and speculation by using ADA as the sole currency. There is no platform token, no liquidity pool, no investment narrative, and no regulatory risk. This makes Couponium one of the first Cardano projects deliberately built for high-volume real-world adoption, not token sales. Businesses mint coupons using ADA, consumers purchase them with ADA, and redemption is verified by burning the NFT on-chain—solving fraud, duplication, and misuse instantly.\n\n\n\nThe Market Manager Program is another layer of innovation. Instead of relying on top-down marketing, Couponium empowers community members to act as decentralized business-acquisition partners. Market Managers earn 75% of all platform fees generated by the businesses they onboard—paid automatically in ADA via smart contract. This creates a self-sustaining, decentralized onboarding engine capable of scaling across cities and industries. No other coupon system or Web3 project uses this grassroots incentive model to grow adoption at the local level.\n\n\n\nLastly, Couponium is built with MVP simplicity and future extensibility in mind. While the initial version focuses on minting, listing, and redeeming coupons, the architecture enables future expansion into loyalty programs, AI-generated coupons, coupon recycling, subscription bundles, and analytics dashboards. Its innovative combination of simplicity, transparency, openness, ADA utility, and real-world use cases makes Couponium unlike anything currently in the Cardano ecosystem—or the global coupon market.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"The Couponium MVP will demonstrate a fully functional end-to-end coupon lifecycle using ADA and Cardano NFTs, accessible through a modern web interface. The MVP will show businesses how to create and mint coupons on the blockchain, list them in a marketplace, and redeem them in-store using QR verification. This proves that blockchain can solve real-world problems without adding friction or requiring users to understand smart contracts, tokens, or technical concepts.\n\n\n\nThe prototype will include three main portals:\n\n\n\n1. Business Dashboard (Web App)\n\n\n\nBusinesses can:\n\n\n\nCreate coupon offers (value, expiration, quantity)\n\n\n\nMint coupon NFTs using ADA\n\n\n\nPublish coupons to the marketplace\n\n\n\nTrack sales and redemption analytics\n\n\n\nRedeem coupons by scanning consumer QR codes\n\n\n\nThis demonstrates practical utility: a small business can use Cardano within minutes.\n\n\n\n2.

This removes the complexity, fragmentation, and fraud issues that plague traditional coupon systems while enabling real-world utility for Cardano.\n\n\n\nBusinesses use a simple dashboard to create coupon offers and mint them as NFTs through an ADA payment. These NFTs are listed automatically in a marketplace where consumers can browse and purchase them using ADA. When redeemed in-store, the business scans a QR code that verifies ownership and burns the coupon NFT via a smart contract, guaranteeing single-use redemption and eliminating fraud, duplicates, and screenshot abuse.\n\n\n\nTo ensure rapid real-world adoption, Couponium introduces a Market Manager Program. Market Managers are community members who onboard local businesses and earn 75% of all platform fees generated by those businesses. This decentralized incentive model solves the biggest adoption challenge—getting real businesses onto the platform—without requiring a large corporate sales force. It also creates new income opportunities for the Cardano community and helps spread ADA usage organically across cities.\n\n\n\nThe MVP consists of three smart contracts (minting, marketplace, redemption), a clean web interface for businesses and consumers, and a dedicated portal for Market Managers. AI tools significantly reduce development time and cost, allowing the project to deliver full functionality on a lean budget while maintaining security and quality.\n\n\n\nBy providing a simple, transparent, fraud-proof, and incentive-driven coupon marketplace, Couponium directly addresses the needs of businesses, consumers, and the Cardano ecosystem—unlocking practical, daily ADA utility in the real world.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"Couponium will create meaningful, measurable, and lasting impact for the Cardano community by driving real-world usage of ADA and showcasing how blockchain can solve everyday problems for businesses and consumers. While many blockchain projects focus on speculation or niche technical use cases, Couponium provides a practical tool that any local business can adopt with zero blockchain knowledge. This helps bridge the gap between Web2 businesses and Web3 capabilities, showing Cardano as a reliable and accessible platform for real commerce.\n\n\n\nThe project encourages daily ADA transactions as businesses mint coupons, consumers purchase them, and Market Managers earn fees. This increases wallet activity, transaction volume, and visibility of ADA as a functional payment asset. Every action—minting, buying, burning—creates on-chain events that contribute to the health and utility of the ecosystem.\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest impacts is the Market Manager Program, which empowers Cardano community members to become local ambassadors who onboard businesses into the ecosystem. This decentralizes growth and removes reliance on traditional marketing or corporate partnerships. It creates income opportunities for community members and spreads real-world Cardano adoption across cities, industries, and customer bases—something no other coupon or NFT marketplace currently offers.\n\n\n\nCouponium also demonstrates the power of Cardano NFTs beyond art or collectibles by using them for verifiable, single-use coupons. This introduces millions of potential users to a new category of blockchain utility. By making NFTs functional, simple, and valuable to everyday people, Couponium strengthens Cardano’s reputation as a platform built for real financial and commercial solutions.\n\n\n\nOver time, this project can inspire additional innovations such as AI-generated promotions, loyalty programs, identity-enabled coupon targeting, or multi-business offers—all powered by Cardano. The MVP lays the foundation for an entire on-chain commerce ecosystem that expands Cardano’s reach and utility far beyond the crypto community.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?","format":null,"answer":"I have the capability to deliver this project with high levels of trust, accountability, and efficiency due to a combination of real-world entrepreneurial experience, hands-on development knowledge, and a proven track record of building Cardano-based applications. As a long-time Cardano community member and operator of the PARAD stake pool since the ITN era, I have consistently demonstrated reliability, transparency, and follow-through. Over the past several years, I have self-funded multiple Web applications and blockchain integrations, including the OneVote project, which gave me practical experience coordinating developers, designing user flows, and delivering usable tools.\n\n\n\nThis project leverages an AI-assisted development model, allowing me to dramatically accelerate front-end builds, documentation, smart contract scaffolding, and QA processes. AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, and Lovable.dev reduce development time by generating components, boilerplate code, architectural patterns, and test cases. This makes the project not only feasible on a lean budget but also faster to deliver with fewer bottlenecks. The remaining mission-critical components—smart contract finalization, security validation, and integration—will be executed by experienced developers who have already worked with me on prior Cardano projects.\n\n\n\nFeasibility is further strengthened by the simplicity of the MVP architecture: three smart contracts (minting, marketplace, redemption), a web dashboard, a consumer marketplace, and the Market Manager system. The ADA-only model eliminates tokenomics, liquidity pools, and regulatory overhead, making the scope tightly focused and highly executable within the 26-week timeline.\n\n\n\nTo validate the approach, the MVP will be tested on the Cardano testnet with real businesses and Market Managers in Southwest Florida, where I already operate multiple businesses and community networks. Success will be measured through minting tests, QR redemption flow, ADA fee splits, and real-world user feedback. On-chain metrics such as coupon mints, purchases, and redemptions will provide transparent and verifiable proof that the system works as intended before mainnet deployment.\n\n\n\nThis combination of community trust, real-world business experience, AI-accelerated development, proven collaborators, and a clearly scoped MVP ensures that the project is both technically feasible and highly likely to be completed successfully.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Milestones","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Project Milestones","description":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":null,"title":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","description":"The number of milestones required depends on the amount of funding requested.

AI handles 70–80% of boilerplate coding, UI generation, documentation, and test scaffolding. Human developers focus only on mission-critical smart contract logic, security, and integration. This reduces the overall budget to $23,000 while maintaining high-quality engineering standards and accelerating time to delivery.”","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Value for Money","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"How does the cost of the project represent value for the Cardano ecosystem?","description":"How does the cost of the project represent value for the Cardano ecosystem?","format":null,"answer":"This project delivers significant value for the Cardano ecosystem by creating a real-world utility application—NFT coupons powered entirely by ADA—at an extremely low cost compared to typical Web3 development. A full end-to-end smart contract system, marketplace, dashboard, and mainnet launch normally represents a budget of $75,000–$150,000. By leveraging an AI-assisted workflow, careful scope control, and a lean execution strategy, this MVP can be delivered for just $23,000, making it one of the most cost-effective real-world adoption initiatives proposed in this fund.\n\n\n\nAI tools reduce development time by generating code scaffolding, UI layouts, documentation, testing scripts, and logic patterns, allowing the project lead and a small developer team to accomplish work that traditionally requires a larger engineering staff. This means Catalyst funding is used efficiently and directly toward deliverables rather than overhead or prolonged development cycles. The project’s minimal smart contract footprint (minting, marketplace, redemption) ensures both low cost and low risk, while still enabling high-impact real-world use.\n\n\n\nThe return on investment for Cardano is substantial: every coupon mint, sale, and redemption produces on-chain ADA transactions, increasing network activity and demonstrating practical blockchain use cases. The Market Manager model decentralizes onboarding and creates new earning opportunities within the Cardano community without requiring additional funding. Even a small number of participating businesses will generate recurring ADA usage, reinforcing Cardano’s position as a platform for real commerce.\n\n\n\nFor only $23,000, Catalyst receives a publicly accessible mainnet application, open smart contracts, onboarding tools, and a scalable adoption engine that can grow organically through Market Managers. This is high-impact, low-cost, and aligned with Catalyst’s mission to accelerate ecosystem growth responsibly and sustainably.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only; excludes retroactive funding, incentives, giveaways, re-granting, or sub-treasuries.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/yesNoChoice","title":"Have you previously submitted a project in Catalyst that was funded and is not yet completed?","description":"Do you have not yet completed projects?","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/tagInput","title":"Project ID's","description":"If you answered “yes” to the previous question, please select first how many there are in total and then list all IDs for any projects you are currently involved in that have not been completed yet.","format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":null,"title":"Project ID","description":"Seven digit project ID from Catalyst website","format":null,"answer":"1100210","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

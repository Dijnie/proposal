# Proposal Review: Revolutionize Shopping Rewards with ADA Cashback

**Proposal ID:** 1738
**Proposer:** Toluwalope Toluwanimi Lasisi
**Requested Funds:** 60,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 12 months
**Theme:** Community & Outreach - Community

## Summary
This proposal aims to create a cross-border shopping rewards platform (Shopxlink) that provides ADA cashback to users shopping from international vendors like Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba, targeting African users while onboarding them to Cardano wallets.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 2
The proposal promises 10,000+ wallet creations and 5,000 users, but the business model is unclear. The impact claim depends heavily on user acquisition and merchant adoption, which are not adequately addressed. The "5-10% cashback" mechanism lacks technical explanation for sustainability. How does the platform generate revenue to fund cashback? No clear Cardano-specific value beyond using ADA as reward token.

### Feasibility ⭐ 2
Significant concerns about team capability and technical approach. The team consists of a single founder with an unverified LinkedIn profile (URL provided is generic). No technical team members identified. The proposal lacks detail on payment gateway integration, compliance with international financial regulations, merchant partnerships, and smart contract architecture. The budget breakdown is vague (20,000 ADA for "wallet infrastructure" with no technical specification). Cross-border payment platforms require substantial regulatory compliance, which is not addressed.

### Value for Money ⭐ 2
60,000 ADA for 12 months with minimal technical detail and no proven team is concerning. The budget allocates 20,000 ADA to "cashback pool" but provides no sustainability model. Marketing budget (15,000 ADA) exceeds technical development (20,000 ADA), suggesting marketing-first approach without proven product. No MVP or prototype demonstrated. Cost per wallet ($5-6 assuming $0.50/ADA) is competitive, but only if delivery is credible.

## Strengths
- Addresses real user pain point (shopping rewards) in African market
- Clear target metrics (10,000 wallets, 5,000 users)
- Attempts to integrate Cardano into everyday consumer activity
- Open-source commitment (MIT license)

## Concerns
- Single-person team with unverified credentials
- No technical specification for payment gateway, merchant integration, or smart contract logic
- Unclear revenue model to sustain cashback rewards
- No mention of regulatory compliance for cross-border financial services
- No existing partnerships with merchants (Amazon, eBay, Alibaba)
- Budget heavily weighted toward marketing rather than technical development
- No MVP, prototype, or proof of concept demonstrated
- Success metrics lack adoption-focused KPIs (e.g., transaction volume, retention rate)
- 12-month timeline is optimistic for building compliant cross-border payment platform

## Recommendation
**DO NOT FUND** - While the concept has merit, the proposal lacks technical depth, team credibility, and a viable business model. The absence of merchant partnerships, regulatory planning, and technical specifications makes successful delivery highly unlikely. The team should return with a stronger technical plan, verifiable team credentials, and an MVP demonstrating feasibility before requesting 60,000 ADA.

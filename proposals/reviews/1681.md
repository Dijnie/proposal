# Catalyst Proposal Review - 1681

**Proposal**: Research-Backed Viral Shorts to Bust Cardano Myths
**Category**: Cardano Open: Ecosystem
**Requested Amount**: 60,000 ADA
**Review Date**: 2025-12-04

## Scoring Summary (1-5 Stars)

| Dimension | Stars | Rating |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Impact | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5) | GOOD |
| Feasibility | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) | GREAT |
| Value for Money | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5) | GOOD |
| **Average** | **4.3/5** | **GOOD** |

## Impact Review (4/5 Stars)
**Rating**: GOOD

**Strengths:**
- Addresses persistent FUD: "ghost chain," "not decentralized" myths
- Evidence-based refutational messaging approach backed by research
- 5-10 myth-busting short videos (30-90s) optimized for social sharing
- Creator Playbook enables community replication
- RCT-based effectiveness testing provides scientific validation
- Open source: CC BY 4.0 for content, MIT for code

**Weaknesses:**
- Reach target (10K views in month 1) is modest for "viral" goal
- Myth correction effectiveness may be limited in polarized crypto discourse
- Competition for attention on TikTok/YouTube from crypto content creators

## Feasibility Review (5/5 Stars)
**Rating**: GREAT

**Strengths:**
- Dr. Robert Danielson brings exceptional credentials: PhD Educational Psychology, 25+ peer-reviewed publications, $2M in NSF/NIH grants
- Published meta-analysis on refutational approaches - exact methodology being used
- Contributing chapter on conceptual change for Oxford handbook
- Alex James (MA): technology product management, CEO of Agnostica
- Prior Catalyst success: Fund 13 Project #1300172 completed all milestones on time
- 8-month timeline with clear milestones

**Weaknesses:**
- RCT requires participant recruitment and may face logistical challenges
- AI-assisted video production quality depends on tool selection

## Value for Money Review (4/5 Stars)
**Rating**: GOOD

**Strengths:**
- Clear budget: $45,000 researcher compensation (550 hours × 2)
- $1,000 for expenses and participation incentives
- AI-efficient production (<5 hrs/video) keeps costs down
- Comprehensive deliverables: Myth Map, videos, messaging guide, playbook, RCT report
- All outputs open-source for community reuse

**Weaknesses:**
- 60,000 ADA for 5-10 videos seems high despite research component
- Primary researcher compensation dominates budget
- Participation incentives budget ($1,000) may limit RCT sample size

## Overall Assessment

This proposal stands out for its rigorous academic foundation. Dr. Robert Danielson's credentials in educational psychology and refutational learning methods are exceptional - 25+ peer-reviewed publications, $2M in competitive research funding, and an upcoming Oxford handbook chapter on exactly this topic.

The approach is methodologically sound: map myths → develop evidence-based refutations → produce AI-assisted video shorts → create replicable playbook → validate effectiveness via RCT. The prior Catalyst success (Fund 13 Project #1300172 completed on time) demonstrates delivery capability.

The "refutational messaging" approach is research-validated but novel in crypto marketing. The sample analysis of Charles Hoskinson's rebuttal to Justin Bons demonstrates practical application of the methodology.

Concerns include the modest reach targets (10K views) for content aimed to be "viral," and the high proportion of budget allocated to researcher compensation. The RCT component, while scientifically valuable, may be challenging to execute with statistical significance given budget constraints.

Overall, this is a uniquely research-grounded approach to Cardano's narrative challenges, led by genuine domain experts with proven delivery track records.

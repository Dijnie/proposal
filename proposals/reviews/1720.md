# Proposal Review: Cardano Gaming Platform with NFT Rewards

**Proposal ID:** 1720
**Proposer:** Marcus Chen
**Requested Funds:** 60,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 10 months
**Theme:** Products & Integrations

## Summary
This proposal builds a web-based gaming platform where players earn NFT rewards for achievements, integrating Cardano wallet authentication and NFT minting to onboard gamers to the Cardano ecosystem.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 3
Gaming + NFTs is a proven onboarding vector (see Axie Infinity, Gods Unchained). Targets non-crypto-native gamers, which aligns with ecosystem growth goals. However, success metrics are vague: "1000 players, 500 NFTs minted" without engagement depth (daily active users? Retention rate?). No evidence of game design expertise or market research showing demand for THIS specific game. Competitive GameFi space means novelty/quality is critical - proposal doesn't address game loop, retention mechanics, or differentiation.

### Feasibility ⭐ 2
Team described as "game developers + blockchain engineers" but NO verifiable credentials: no game studio portfolio, no shipped games, no GitHub repos for blockchain work. Game development is notoriously complex and over-schedule. 10-month timeline for game design + development + NFT smart contracts + testing is extremely aggressive, suggesting inexperience. Technical architecture absent (game engine? Wallet integration method? NFT metadata standard?). No game design document preview shared.

### Value for Money ⭐ 2
60,000 ADA for a gaming platform is substantial. Budget breakdown is vague: 35k game dev, 15k NFT contracts, 7k marketing, 3k ops - lacks itemization (artist costs? Game designer salary? Server infrastructure?). Professional game development typically costs more, suggesting either: (1) team is undervaluing work (risk of abandonment), or (2) game will be low-quality. No revenue model mentioned - is this sustainable beyond initial funding?

## Strengths
- Gaming is effective user onboarding channel (non-crypto natives)
- NFT rewards provide tangible incentive for engagement
- 10-month timeline allows iterative development
- Targets ecosystem growth through new user acquisition

## Concerns
- **CRITICAL**: ZERO verifiable team credentials (no game portfolio, GitHub, LinkedIn)
- No game design document, genre, mechanics, or differentiation explained
- Extremely aggressive timeline (10 months for full game + NFT integration)
- Missing technical architecture (game engine, wallet integration, NFT standard)
- Vague success metrics (no retention/engagement depth metrics)
- Budget lacks granular breakdown (artist, designer, dev costs missing)
- No market validation (who is target player? What game genre?)
- Saturated GameFi market requires high-quality execution to compete
- No revenue/sustainability model (post-funding operations?)
- No smart contract audit mentioned (NFT minting security)

## Recommendation
**DO NOT FUND** - Gaming projects require proven expertise in game design, development, and live operations - none evidenced here. Anonymous team with no shipped games requesting 60k ADA for a 10-month full-game build is unrealistic. GameFi space is littered with abandoned projects that promised blockchain-integrated games but delivered poor gameplay. Without verifiable team credentials, game design preview, technical architecture, and realistic timeline, this represents very high risk with low probability of delivering quality product that attracts/retains players.

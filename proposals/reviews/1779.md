# Proposal Review: CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN EDUCATION FOR TAMALE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS

**Proposal ID:** 1779
**Proposer:** ABDUL-RAZAK ALHASSAN
**Requested Funds:** 42,525 ADA
**Project Duration:** Unknown (not specified in extracted data)
**Theme:** Education

## Summary
This proposal aims to educate 200 students from University for Development Studies and Tamale Technical University about Cardano blockchain fundamentals and practical skills, fostering ADA adoption and ecosystem growth in northern Ghana.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 3
Moderate impact potential. Training 200 university students creates a pipeline for future builders and increases awareness in Ghana's northern region. Universities are strategic targets for long-term ecosystem growth. However, the proposal lacks detail on what "practical skills" entails—wallet creation, smart contract development, or basic blockchain literacy? Impact measurement is vague ("fostering ADA adoption") without specific KPIs like wallet creation numbers, projects built, or Catalyst proposals drafted.

### Feasibility ⭐ 2
Feasibility concerns exist. No team information is provided beyond the proposer name. What teaching experience does the team have? Who will deliver the curriculum? What partnerships exist with the universities? The budget of 42,525 ADA is oddly specific but not explained. Timeline is not specified. Without team credentials, curriculum outline, or university confirmation letters, execution risk is high.

### Value for Money ⭐ 2
At 42,525 ADA for 200 students, this equates to ~212 ADA per student (~$75-$85), which is reasonable for educational programs. However, the unusual budget amount (why 42,525 instead of rounded figures?) raises questions about cost calculation methodology. Without a line-item breakdown showing venue costs, materials, instructor fees, and equipment, value cannot be properly assessed. The budget appears mid-high for what seems to be basic blockchain education without clear technical depth.

## Strengths
- **University Focus**: Targeting educational institutions creates sustainable pipeline
- **Geographic Diversity**: Tamale (northern Ghana) is underserved compared to Accra-focused projects
- **Dual Universities**: Partnering with UDS and Tamale Technical University increases reach
- **Youth Targeting**: Students are ideal demographic for long-term ecosystem contribution
- **Regional Growth**: Expands Cardano presence in Ghana beyond capital city

## Concerns
- **No Team Information**: Beyond proposer name, no credentials, bios, or LinkedIn profiles provided
- **Vague Curriculum**: "Blockchain fundamentals and practical skills" lacks specificity
- **Missing KPIs**: No clear success metrics (wallets created, projects built, retention rates)
- **Budget Oddity**: 42,525 ADA is unusually specific without explanation
- **No Breakdown**: Zero line-item cost detail for materials, venues, instructors, equipment
- **University Partnerships**: No confirmation letters or MoUs mentioned
- **Timeline Absent**: Project duration not specified
- **No Track Record**: No evidence of prior blockchain education delivery

## Recommendation
**DO NOT FUND** - While the intent to educate Ghanaian university students is commendable, the proposal lacks fundamental information required for funding assessment. No team credentials, no curriculum details, no university partnerships documented, no budget breakdown, and no clear success metrics. The proposer should resubmit with: (1) full team bios with verifiable experience, (2) detailed curriculum, (3) university partnership confirmation, (4) itemized budget, and (5) specific, measurable KPIs.

# Proposal Review: Cardano for Non-Techies Series

**Proposal ID:** 1701
**Proposer:** Gigi Sandor
**Requested Funds:** 20,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 3 months
**Theme:** Education & Training

## Summary
This proposal creates a 15-episode educational video series targeting non-technical users, explaining Cardano's DeFi, staking, wallets, and blockchain basics through accessible storytelling to onboard new users.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 3
The proposal targets a valid pain point - technical barriers for newcomers - but impact is limited. While 15 videos may help some users, success metrics lack specificity (vague views/engagement goals). No clear pathway showing how watchers convert to active on-chain users. 100 wallets/50 stakers in 3 months is modest for 20k ADA investment.

### Feasibility ⭐ 4
Strong team credentials with proven video production experience (VISM Studio, 8+ years). Clear production plan, realistic 3-month timeline. Milestones are well-structured. However, slight concern: no verifiable links to team portfolios/previous work provided. Budget allocation is reasonable for video production quality promised.

### Value for Money ⭐ 2
At 20,000 ADA for 15 videos (~1,333 ADA/video or ~$533/video at current rates), the cost is steep compared to other educational content proposals. Budget breakdown shows 10,000 ADA for video production but lacks granular detail (e.g., cost per video, crew rates). For educational content that may become outdated, this represents weak ROI. No plan for content updates or ongoing community value beyond initial 3 months.

## Strengths
- Addresses real barrier to adoption (complexity for non-tech users)
- Experienced media production team (8 years VISM Studio)
- Clear milestone structure with defined deliverables
- Open-source commitment (CC BY 4.0 license)
- Covers important topics (wallets, staking, DeFi basics)

## Concerns
- High cost per video unit (~1,333 ADA each) without clear justification
- Vague success metrics ("engagement," "views" without targets)
- No verification links for team credentials/portfolio
- Limited adoption pathway (watching videos → on-chain activity unclear)
- Content may become outdated; no sustainability plan
- Modest onboarding target (100 wallets) for budget size
- Missing detail on distribution strategy beyond YouTube

## Recommendation
**CONSIDER** - This proposal has merit in addressing accessibility but needs refinement. The team appears capable, but value-for-money is questionable. Would benefit from: (1) clearer cost breakdown per video, (2) specific distribution/promotion strategy with measurable KPIs, (3) verifiable team credentials, (4) stronger adoption metrics showing how content drives on-chain activity. At current budget, impact seems limited for 20k ADA investment.

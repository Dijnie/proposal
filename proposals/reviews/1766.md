# Proposal Review: Cardano High School Scholars Club for Underserved Areas

**Proposal ID:** 1766
**Proposer:** Sunday Dominic
**Requested Funds:** 55,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 6 months
**Theme:** Education - Training

## Summary
This proposal by 12 Miles organization seeks to deliver Cardano blockchain education to 5,000+ high school students in underserved Nigerian communities through 10-week in-person training, culminating in a tech conference and Quizathon competition, building on their successful Fund13 project (1300167).

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 4
Strong grassroots education impact. Targets 5,000+ high school students in rural Nigeria, addressing digital divide and introducing blockchain early. 12 Miles has proven track record: trained 11,000+ students since 2020, 5,000+ in 2025 via Catalyst Fund13, with media coverage (TVC News). In-person delivery ensures engagement and community building. Expected outputs: 5,000 students trained, 70%+ attendance, 80%+ knowledge increase, student projects completed. Pathway to ecosystem contribution unclear but foundation is strong. Tech conference + Quizathon creates excitement and recognition. Replicable model for underserved areas globally.

### Feasibility ⭐ 4
Highly feasible with proven team and execution history. 12 Miles is formally incorporated with 3+ years delivering STEM education to 11,000+ students. Fund13 success (5,000 students trained) validates capability. Team includes project lead (Sunday Dominic), curriculum developer (Mautin Olayemi), community coordinator (Ojo Christiana), blockchain lead (Fasonda James), and evaluation specialist (Sulaimon Fanimokun). Timeline is realistic: Month 1-2 curriculum + school onboarding, Month 2-5 in-person delivery, Month 6 conference. Budget breakdown is detailed and sensible. Schools already engaged (mentions 8-12 target schools). Main risk is curriculum depth—teaching wallets, smart contracts, DApps to high schoolers in 10 weeks is ambitious but scoped appropriately for awareness vs. professional training.

### Value for Money ⭐ 5
Exceptional value at 55,000 ADA for 5,000 students. Cost per student is 11 ADA (~$5.50 at $0.50/ADA), which is incredibly low for in-person blockchain education. Budget breakdown: 15,000 ADA curriculum + onboarding, 25,000 ADA program delivery (largest allocation—correct), 15,000 ADA conference + Quizathon. Operating in Nigeria with proven low-cost model enables scale. Majority of budget (25,000 ADA) goes directly to teaching delivery. Conference/Quizathon adds engagement and recognition. If deliverables met, this represents best value-for-money among education proposals reviewed.

## Strengths
- Proven track record: 11,000+ students trained since 2020, 5,000 via Fund13 (project 1300167)
- Formally incorporated organization with transparent operations
- Media coverage validates impact (TVC News, social media presence)
- In-person delivery ensures engagement (not virtual webinars)
- Targets underserved rural high schools (real equity impact)
- Detailed team with clear roles (curriculum, community, blockchain, evaluation)
- Realistic timeline and budget for scale (5,000 students)
- Tech conference + Quizathon adds excitement and community building
- Excellent cost efficiency ($5.50 per student)
- Supporting documentation includes videos, photos, drive folders

## Concerns
- Curriculum teaches advanced topics (wallets, smart contracts, DApps) in 10 weeks to high schoolers—depth may be limited
- Pathway from training to ecosystem contribution unclear (no job placement, internships, ongoing engagement)
- Success metric "knowledge increase 80%+" measured via surveys—needs objective assessment (quizzes, projects)
- Conference/Quizathon budget (15,000 ADA) includes prizes, venue, but no detail on judging or awards structure
- Team LinkedIn profiles not fully provided (only project lead mentioned in relevant experience)
- No mention of post-training support or alumni network
- Tech conference targets 800 students but proposal trained 5,000—why only 16% attend?
- Open-source curriculum not yet published on GitHub for review

## Recommendation
**FUND** - This is one of the strongest education proposals with proven delivery, excellent value, and real equity impact. 12 Miles has validated capability via Fund13 success and 3 years of STEM education. In-person delivery in underserved Nigerian schools addresses critical talent gap. Budget is lean and realistic. Minor improvements: (1) publish curriculum on GitHub for transparency, (2) provide all team LinkedIn profiles, (3) clarify pathway from training to ecosystem contribution (e.g., Catalyst mentorship, developer bootcamp for top students), (4) add objective assessment (projects, quizzes) beyond surveys, and (5) explain why only 800/5,000 students attend conference. Overall, strong recommend to fund based on track record and value.

# Proposal Review: Cardano NFT Marketplace with Escrow Smart Contract

**Proposal ID:** 1706
**Proposer:** Yuliya Suhorukova
**Requested Funds:** 60,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 12 months
**Theme:** DeFi & Financial Services

## Summary
This proposal aims to build a Cardano NFT marketplace with escrow smart contracts to enable secure P2P transactions, targeting creators and collectors seeking decentralized, trustless trading.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 2
Limited differentiation in crowded NFT marketplace space. Cardano already has established marketplaces (JPG.store, artano.io, etc.). Proposal doesn't clearly articulate unique value beyond "escrow" (which existing platforms already handle via smart contracts). Success metrics are generic (users, transactions) without baseline comparisons. Unclear how this attracts users from established competitors.

### Feasibility ⭐ 2
Major red flags on capability. Team description is extremely vague - "experienced in blockchain, smart contracts, frontend" without names, LinkedIn profiles, GitHub repos, or verifiable credentials. No evidence of prior Plutus/Aiken development. No technical architecture details. 12-month timeline with only 3 milestones suggests poor planning granularity. Escrow smart contract development is non-trivial but treated casually.

### Value for Money ⭐ 1
Very poor value. 60,000 ADA for what appears to be a basic marketplace with standard features. Budget breakdown is superficial - "30k development, 15k marketing, 10k operations, 5k contingency" without itemization. No team salaries specified, no tech stack costs detailed. Comparable projects delivered for less. High risk of fund mismanagement given vague team and plan.

## Strengths
- Escrow mechanism addresses trust concerns (though not unique)
- 12-month timeline allows thorough development
- Open-source commitment stated

## Concerns
- **CRITICAL**: No verifiable team credentials (no names, LinkedIn, GitHub)
- Saturated market with established competitors (JPG.store, etc.)
- Vague technical approach (Plutus vs Aiken unclear, no architecture)
- Generic success metrics without competitive benchmarking
- Budget lacks granular breakdown
- Only 3 milestones for 12-month project = poor planning detail
- No user research or market validation evidence
- Missing risk analysis (regulatory, technical, market)
- No clear differentiation strategy

## Recommendation
**DO NOT FUND** - This proposal exhibits multiple critical deficiencies. The anonymous team with no verifiable credentials poses unacceptable accountability risk. The market is saturated with established NFT platforms, and this proposal fails to articulate compelling differentiation. Budget is excessive for unclear deliverables. Without team transparency, technical specifics, and market validation, this represents high risk with low probability of ecosystem value delivery.

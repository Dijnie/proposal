# Proposal Review: PR Workshop for Cardano Projects by professional PR agency

**Proposal ID:** 1797
**Proposer:** Christopher Flato
**Requested Funds:** 60,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 4 months
**Theme:** Community Outreach

## Summary
Yellow House GmbH, a German PR agency, proposes to deliver PR curriculum development, workshop delivery, and post-workshop support to train Cardano projects in professional public relations strategies, increasing ecosystem visibility and media engagement.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 3
Moderate impact potential. Professional PR skills are genuinely needed in the Cardano ecosystem—many technically strong projects lack marketing/communications expertise. Training projects to handle media, messaging, and public outreach could amplify ecosystem visibility. However, impact depends heavily on: (1) which projects attend, (2) whether they apply learnings, and (3) whether improved PR translates to user growth or funding. The proposal lacks specifics on participant selection, number of projects, or success metrics beyond workshop delivery. Passive training without implementation support may have limited lasting effect.

### Feasibility ⭐ 4
Good feasibility. Yellow House GmbH is an established PR agency, providing professional credibility. Christopher Flato has ESL background (communication experience) and Nils Lassen is co-team member. Creating PR curriculum and delivering workshops are core competencies for a PR agency. The 4-month timeline (20k curriculum, 20k workshop, 10k post-support, 10k marketing) is realistic. Main risk is whether the team understands Cardano ecosystem nuances—generic PR training may not address decentralized governance, community-first culture, or technical messaging unique to blockchain.

### Value for Money ⭐ 2
Value concerns exist. At 60,000 ADA (maximum category funding), this is expensive for a 4-month workshop program. Budget breakdown: 33% curriculum, 33% workshop delivery, 17% post-workshop support, 17% marketing. Without knowing number of participants, workshop duration, or materials depth, ROI is unclear. Professional PR agency rates are high, but 60,000 ADA (~$21,000-$27,000) for a single workshop program seems premium. The proposal would deliver better value if: (1) curriculum was open-source for broader use, (2) participant numbers were substantial (20+ projects), or (3) post-workshop support included ongoing mentorship.

## Strengths
- **Professional Expertise**: Yellow House GmbH is established PR agency vs. amateur trainers
- **Genuine Need**: Many Cardano projects lack professional PR/communications skills
- **Structured Approach**: Curriculum development → workshop delivery → post-support
- **Post-Workshop Support**: 10k ADA allocated for follow-up (unlike one-off trainings)
- **Ecosystem Awareness**: Team acknowledges Cardano-specific communication needs
- **German Quality**: German business culture emphasizes thoroughness and professionalism

## Concerns
- **Maximum Funding**: 60,000 ADA is full category cap; high cost for single workshop program
- **Participant Numbers**: How many projects will be trained? Scale unclear
- **Selection Process**: Which projects attend? Application criteria not specified
- **Curriculum Ownership**: Will materials be open-source or proprietary to Yellow House?
- **Ecosystem Understanding**: Do PR strategies account for Cardano's governance and community culture?
- **Success Metrics**: How will improved PR be measured? Media placements? User growth?
- **Limited Team Detail**: Only 2 team members mentioned; who delivers workshops?
- **Geographic Bias**: German agency may have limited understanding of global Cardano community dynamics

## Recommendation
**CONSIDER** - The proposal addresses a genuine ecosystem need with professional expertise, but the 60,000 ADA budget (category maximum) requires stronger justification. Without participant numbers, curriculum ownership details, or success metrics, value assessment is difficult. PR training alone doesn't guarantee adoption—projects need implementation support and accountability. Recommend requesting: (1) minimum participant commitment (e.g., 20+ projects), (2) open-source curriculum for ecosystem-wide benefit, (3) clear success metrics (media placements, coverage, user growth), and (4) detailed workshop agenda and materials. Consider funding at reduced amount unless scale and impact can be demonstrated.

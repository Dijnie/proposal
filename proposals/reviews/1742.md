# Proposal Review: Cardano LATAM Hackathon

**Proposal ID:** 1742
**Proposer:** Douglas Caetano
**Requested Funds:** 60,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 4 months
**Theme:** Events & Marketing - Hackathons

## Summary
This proposal seeks to organize a LATAM-wide hackathon targeting 300-500 participants from 5+ countries, focusing on DeFi, gaming, and social impact solutions on Cardano, with both virtual and in-person components across Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 4
Strong potential for ecosystem growth in LATAM region. Targets 300-500 developers across multiple countries, with clear tracks (DeFi, gaming, social impact). Expected outputs include 50-100 project submissions and 3-5 teams potentially advancing to Catalyst funding. Post-event support includes mentorship and VC connections, creating sustainable impact beyond the event. Clear pathway from hackathon to funded projects strengthens Cardano's LATAM developer pipeline.

### Feasibility ⭐ 3
Mixed feasibility signals. Team lead Douglas Caetano has experience organizing Cardano events in LATAM, but the proposal attempts to cover 5+ countries with 3 in-person hubs (Brazil, Argentina, Mexico) in just 4 months. The timeline is aggressive: Month 1 for planning, Month 2-3 for virtual hackathon, Month 4 for in-person finals. Coordinating multi-country events requires strong local partnerships, which are mentioned but not detailed. Budget breakdown shows reasonable allocation, but venue costs for 3 countries may be underestimated. Technical mentorship roster is not specified.

### Value for Money ⭐ 3
60,000 ADA for 300-500 participants across multiple countries represents good reach ($400-600/participant including venue, prizes, marketing). Budget breakdown: 20,000 ADA prizes, 18,000 ADA event logistics (3 countries), 12,000 ADA marketing, 10,000 ADA coordination. However, 3-country in-person execution for 18,000 ADA seems tight. No breakdown of prize distribution (1st, 2nd, 3rd place per track). Value depends on quality of mentorship, which is not detailed.

## Strengths
- Ambitious multi-country reach across LATAM
- Clear tracks aligned with Cardano priorities (DeFi, gaming, social impact)
- Post-event mentorship and VC connections
- Experienced proposer with LATAM event track record
- Hybrid format (virtual + in-person finals) balances accessibility and engagement
- Concrete success metrics (50-100 submissions, 3-5 funded projects)

## Concerns
- Aggressive 4-month timeline for multi-country coordination
- Lack of confirmed local partners in Argentina and Mexico
- No detailed technical mentorship roster or judging criteria
- Venue and logistics costs for 3 countries may be underestimated (18,000 ADA)
- Prize distribution structure not specified (how much per track?)
- No contingency plan if in-person events face travel/visa issues
- Success metric "3-5 funded projects" is aspirational, not guaranteed output
- No mention of how post-event mentorship will be resourced beyond 4-month timeline

## Recommendation
**CONSIDER** - Strong concept with good regional impact potential, but execution risk is high given multi-country scope and compressed timeline. Recommend funding if proposer can provide: (1) confirmed local partners in each country, (2) detailed venue contracts or MOUs, (3) technical mentor roster, (4) prize distribution breakdown, and (5) contingency plan for logistics delays. Consider reducing scope to 2 countries for more realistic delivery.

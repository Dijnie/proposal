# Proposal Review: Cardano Education Hub for African Youth

**Proposal ID:** 1746
**Proposer:** Adeyinka Adewale
**Requested Funds:** 55,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 6 months
**Theme:** Education - Training

## Summary
This proposal aims to establish a Cardano education hub in Nigeria targeting 500 youth (ages 18-30) through in-person workshops covering blockchain basics, Cardano ecosystem, smart contracts, and DApp development, with the goal of creating a talent pipeline for the ecosystem.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 3
Moderate positive impact on ecosystem growth. Targeting 500 Nigerian youth with structured blockchain education addresses talent gap in Africa. Success metrics include 500 trained students, 80% completion rate, 50+ portfolio projects, and 20+ Catalyst proposals. However, the pathway from training to actual ecosystem contribution is unclear. No mention of job placement, internship programs, or ongoing engagement post-training. Impact depends heavily on student quality and retention, which are not validated through pilot program.

### Feasibility ⭐ 3
Team shows some capability but lacks depth. Adeyinka Adewale (project lead) has education background but no verifiable Cardano development experience. Team includes curriculum developer and community coordinator, but no senior blockchain developer or technical mentor roster. Curriculum covers ambitious topics (Plutus, Marlowe, DApp development) in 6 months, which may be unrealistic for beginners. Venue partnership mentioned but not confirmed. Budget includes curriculum development, teaching materials, and venue costs, but no technical infrastructure (e.g., developer environments, testnet ADA).

### Value for Money ⭐ 3
55,000 ADA for 500 students = ~110 ADA per student (~$55 at $0.50/ADA), which is competitive for in-person training. Budget breakdown: 20,000 ADA curriculum + teaching, 15,000 ADA venue + logistics, 10,000 ADA marketing, 10,000 ADA coordination. However, venue costs for 6 months of training seem low for Lagos, Nigeria. No budget for student incentives (testnet ADA, project prizes) to drive engagement. Value depends on quality of instruction, which is unproven.

## Strengths
- Clear target demographic (Nigerian youth 18-30)
- Structured curriculum progression (basics to DApp development)
- Concrete metrics (500 students, 80% completion, 50+ projects)
- Addresses African talent gap in blockchain
- In-person delivery ensures engagement and community building
- Open-source curriculum commitment

## Concerns
- No senior technical mentors or blockchain developers on team
- Curriculum ambition (Plutus, Marlowe in 6 months) may be unrealistic for beginners
- No pilot program or proof of concept to validate approach
- Pathway from training to jobs/ecosystem contribution unclear
- Venue partnership not confirmed with signed agreement
- No budget for technical infrastructure (developer tools, testnet ADA)
- Success metric "20+ Catalyst proposals" is aspirational, not measurable output
- No post-training support or alumni network planned
- Team LinkedIn profiles need verification (generic education experience)

## Recommendation
**CONSIDER** - Solid concept addressing real need, but execution risk due to unproven team and ambitious curriculum. Recommend funding if proposer can provide: (1) confirmed technical mentor roster with Cardano dev experience, (2) signed venue agreement, (3) pilot cohort results (even 20-30 students), (4) revised curriculum scoped to achievable outcomes in 6 months, and (5) post-training engagement plan. Alternatively, reduce scope to 200 students with deeper technical mentorship.

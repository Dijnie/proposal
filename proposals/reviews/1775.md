# Proposal Review: West Africa's Cardano Developer Hub

**Proposal ID:** 1775
**Proposer:** Laurentine Djatsa
**Requested Funds:** 56,250 ADA
**Project Duration:** Unknown (not specified in extracted data)
**Theme:** Training

## Summary
Inkuba Hub proposes to establish West Africa's first Cardano developer center in Burkina Faso, training 100+ developers in Haskell and Plutus through structured education, university onboarding workshops, and expert mentorship to address talent gaps in Francophone West Africa.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 5
Exceptional strategic value for Cardano. Targets Francophone West Africa, a largely untapped region with significant developer potential. Training 100+ developers in Haskell/Plutus directly addresses the ecosystem's critical talent shortage. The proposal leverages three years of prior Cardano advocacy, suggesting strong community foundation. Developer hubs have proven track records (see Emurgo Africa, Gimbalabs) for producing builders and projects. This fills a genuine infrastructure gap.

### Feasibility ⭐ 3
The vision is ambitious but feasibility concerns exist. Training 100+ developers in Haskell/Plutus requires significant mentorship capacity and curriculum depth—Haskell is notoriously difficult for beginners. The proposal mentions "expert mentorship" but lacks detail on who these mentors are, their Cardano expertise, and availability. The 56,250 ADA budget for a full developer hub (space, training, mentorship) seems tight. Timeline is not specified, making it hard to assess delivery pace.

### Value for Money ⭐ 3
At 56,250 ADA for 100+ developers, the cost per developer (~562 ADA or ~$220) is very competitive compared to traditional bootcamps ($5,000-$15,000). However, the budget may be insufficient for a sustained hub operation including rent, utilities, instructor salaries, and curriculum development. The proposal would benefit from a detailed cost breakdown. ROI is potentially high IF developers produce mainnet projects, but this depends on post-training support and employment pathways not clearly outlined.

## Strengths
- **Strategic Geography**: First Cardano hub in Francophone West Africa, filling a critical regional gap
- **Developer Focus**: Directly addresses Cardano's Haskell/Plutus talent shortage
- **University Partnerships**: Onboarding workshops at universities create sustainable pipeline
- **Prior Advocacy**: Three years of Cardano work in Burkina Faso shows commitment and credibility
- **Scale**: 100+ developers trained could significantly expand African builder ecosystem
- **Hub Model**: Physical spaces create community, collaboration, and accountability

## Concerns
- **Incomplete Information**: Timeline, detailed milestones, and mentor credentials not provided in extracted data
- **Haskell Complexity**: Teaching Haskell/Plutus to 100+ beginners is challenging; curriculum and teaching methodology unclear
- **Budget Sufficiency**: 56,250 ADA may be insufficient for rent, salaries, equipment, and operations
- **Mentor Capacity**: No detail on who will teach, their Cardano expertise, or availability
- **Post-Training Support**: Unclear how developers will be supported to build actual projects after training
- **Verification**: No evidence provided of team's technical capability or prior training delivery
- **Political Risk**: Burkina Faso has experienced recent instability; contingency plan not mentioned

## Recommendation
**CONSIDER** - This proposal addresses a genuine strategic need and targets an underserved region, but critical details on feasibility, mentor expertise, and budget breakdown are missing. The vision is compelling, but execution risks are significant. Recommend requesting detailed implementation plan, mentor CVs, curriculum outline, and budget breakdown before funding decision.

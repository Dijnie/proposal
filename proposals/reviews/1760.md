# Proposal Review: 6,000+ New Users via CIP13 ADA Cashback at SovaBar Vietnam

**Proposal ID:** 1760
**Proposer:** SOVA Lounge - Phani Deepak
**Requested Funds:** 50,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 3 months
**Theme:** Community & Outreach - Community

## Summary
This proposal leverages SovaBar, a restaurant/bar in Da Nang, Vietnam, to onboard 6,000+ new Cardano users through ADA cashback on purchases, implementing CPS-0016, CIP-13, and CIP-99 standards for QR-based wallet creation and claim flows, creating a replicable retail onboarding model.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 4
Strong real-world adoption impact. Converts physical retail location into Cardano onboarding funnel using industry-standard CIPs. Cashback programs are proven to drive 20-30% conversion increases (citing Forrester, Deloitte research). Target of 6,000 wallets in 3 months via owned venue with consistent foot traffic is ambitious but grounded in retail reality. Creates tangible use case for Cardano URI standards (CPS-0016, CIP-13, CIP-99) that's been underutilized. Model is replicable for other F&B venues in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. Direct pathway from scan → wallet install → ADA receipt reduces onboarding friction.

### Feasibility ⭐ 4
Highly feasible due to venue ownership. Team lead Phani Deepak has 13+ years F&B experience, owns SovaBar, and has scaled brands across India, USA, Hong Kong, Vietnam. Owning the venue eliminates partnership risk and ensures operational control. Technical implementation of CPS-0016/CIP-99 claim flow is well-documented and follows standards. 3-month timeline is realistic for technical deployment (Month 1), high-volume onboarding (Month 2), and reporting (Month 3). Budget breakdown is detailed and sensible. Main risk is whether 6,000 wallets target is achievable in 3 months—depends on customer volume and conversion rate, which are not validated with historical data.

### Value for Money ⭐ 4
Excellent value at 50,000 ADA for potentially 6,000 wallets. Budget breakdown: 15,000 ADA technical deployment (QR, CIP-99 server, training), 15,000 ADA onboarding activation (ADA cashback subsidies, staff support, optimization), 20,000 ADA project closure (final reporting, closure video, roadmap for scaling). If 6,000 wallets achieved, cost per wallet is ~8.3 ADA (~$4 at $0.50/ADA), which is extremely competitive. Even at 50% of target (3,000 wallets), cost per wallet (~16.6 ADA) is reasonable. Majority of budget goes to ADA cashback incentives and technical infrastructure, which directly drive user acquisition.

## Strengths
- Venue ownership eliminates partnership/dependency risk
- Proven F&B operations experience (13+ years, multiple countries)
- Technical implementation follows established Cardano standards (CPS-0016, CIP-13, CIP-99)
- Clear, detailed technical flow (QR → wallet install → claim → ADA receipt)
- Budget is realistic and well-allocated to technical setup and cashback incentives
- Replicable model for other retail venues (strong ecosystem value)
- Demonstrates real-world utility of Cardano URI standards
- Supporting documentation includes venue photos and social media presence
- 3-month timeline is achievable for owned venue
- Milestone structure is logical and measurable

## Concerns
- 6,000 wallet target in 3 months requires ~67 new wallets/day—not validated with historical customer volume
- No baseline data on SovaBar foot traffic or typical customer conversion rates
- Cashback subsidy budget (8,000 ADA in Milestone 2) may be insufficient if conversion rate is high
- Success depends on staff training and customer willingness to install wallets on-site
- No mention of ongoing engagement strategy post-wallet creation (retention risk)
- Closure report (Milestone 3) mentions "progress toward 6,000 wallets" but doesn't commit to full target
- Technical infrastructure (CIP-99 claim server) not detailed; unclear if built in-house or outsourced
- No mention of multi-language support (Vietnamese/English) for QR instructions
- Sustainability post-funding unclear: will SovaBar continue ADA cashback without Catalyst funds?

## Recommendation
**FUND** - Strong proposal with clear execution plan, credible team, and well-scoped budget. Venue ownership significantly de-risks delivery. Demonstrates practical use of Cardano standards (CPS-0016/CIP-99) in retail context, creating replicable model for ecosystem. Even at 50% of wallet target, delivers excellent value for money. Minor improvements: (1) provide baseline foot traffic data to validate 6,000 wallet target, (2) detail technical implementation of CIP-99 server, (3) increase cashback budget contingency, and (4) add post-onboarding engagement plan (e.g., monthly ADA rewards for return visits). Overall, this is a practical, high-impact proposal. Recommend to fund.

## Scoring Summary (1-5 Stars)

| Dimension | Stars | Rating |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Impact | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5) | ACCEPTABLE |
| Feasibility | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (2/5) | POOR |
| Value for Money | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (2/5) | POOR |
| **Average** | **2.3/5** | **POOR** |

## Impact Review (3/5 Stars)
**Rating**: ACCEPTABLE

**Strengths:**
- Addresses governance frameworks for automated systems at scale
- International scope: 51 countries, 8 languages
- Focus on contributor protection through organizational structures
- Workshops at notable institutions (Central Saint Martins, Tokyo University of Arts)
- UK Property Digital Assets Bill positioning is forward-thinking
- Open source: Apache 2.0 for code, CC BY 4.0 for content

**Weaknesses:**
- Vision is abstract: "governance frameworks automated systems will inherit"
- Success metrics focus on process (schema specifications) not adoption
- Rejection of "vanity metrics" makes impact measurement unclear
- Broad scope may diffuse focus

## Feasibility Review (2/5 Stars)
**Rating**: POOR

**Strengths:**
- Proposer claims 8 years ecosystem participation since 2017
- Central Saint Martins alumni connections for workshops
- Builds on relationship with build.foundation (companion proposal)
- UK CIO with ABS and DAF capacity is novel organizational approach

**Weaknesses:**
- Team section lists only "contributor approach" - no named team members with verified credentials
- University partnerships described as "pre-existing relationships" but no confirmations provided
- 12-month timeline for entity formation, workshops, and schema development is extremely ambitious
- Dependency on build.foundation (external proposal) for technical validation
- Proposer identifies as "Self Sovereign" - no verifiable identity or portfolio

## Value for Money Review (2/5 Stars)
**Rating**: POOR

**Strengths:**
- Budget breakdown by milestone is provided
- Milestone 1 (25,321 ADA) covers workshop facilitation, design, platform
- Explicitly mentions ADA price volatility concern

**Weaknesses:**
- Primary deliverables are schemas and framework documents - intangible outputs
- Workshop costs (6,000 ADA venue/travel) for unconfirmed partnerships
- "Milestone-threshold approach" delays hiring until funding - no team assembled
- 54,321 ADA for workshops and documentation without concrete products
- Companion proposal (build.foundation) not evaluated together

## Overall Assessment

This proposal presents an ambitious vision for creating governance frameworks that automated systems will inherit, spanning 51 countries and 8 languages. The conceptual framework around contributor protection and multidisciplinary governance is intellectually interesting.

However, significant feasibility concerns emerge: The proposer identifies only as "Self Sovereign" with no verifiable identity or portfolio beyond claiming "8 years visible participation." The team section describes a "contributor approach" where team members will be hired only after funding - meaning no assembled team exists.

University partnerships with Central Saint Martins, Tokyo University of Arts, and Institute of Science Tokyo are described as having "pre-existing relationships" but no letters of intent or confirmations are provided. The dependency on build.foundation (a separate proposal) for technical validation creates cross-proposal risk.

The success metrics explicitly reject traditional adoption measures, focusing instead on "schema specifications" and "mutual influence" between governance and technical decisions - outcomes that are difficult to verify.

The budget of 54,321 ADA for workshops, schema development, and framework documentation produces primarily intangible outputs. While the governance challenges addressed are real, the execution pathway lacks the concrete team, partnerships, and deliverables needed for high confidence.

# Proposal Review: Voices on Chain: Access for Ethiopia's Youth and Women

**Proposal ID:** 1773
**Proposer:** Nahom Behailu Geremew
**Requested Funds:** 22,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 6 months
**Theme:** Training

## Summary
This proposal aims to train 300 Ethiopian youth and women in hands-on Cardano usage through workshops and mentoring, teaching wallet setup, ADA transactions, NFT minting, and dApp interactions to expand blockchain access in East Africa.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 4
Strong potential for ecosystem expansion in Ethiopia, targeting 300 participants with measurable outputs including 120+ wallet creations and on-chain transactions. Clear focus on underserved demographics (youth and women) in a high-potential African market. The program creates a pipeline for future builders and Catalyst participants, though long-term retention strategies could be strengthened.

### Feasibility ⭐ 4
The Stella Events team demonstrates relevant experience delivering youth and community programs. The proposal includes structured milestones with clear pilot workshops, recruitment targets, and accountability measures. The 6-month timeline is realistic, though the team could provide more detail on specific technical expertise with Cardano tools. Partnerships with universities and women-led organizations add credibility.

### Value for Money ⭐ 4
At 22,000 ADA for 300 participants, this equates to ~73 ADA per person trained. The budget allocation is reasonable with 34% for setup/pilot, 45% for main training, and 18% for sustainability. Strong ROI potential given the scale of wallet creation, on-chain activity, and community formation. Budget breakdown could be more granular.

## Strengths
- **Scale and Reach**: Training 300 participants with 120+ wallet creations provides verifiable, measurable impact
- **Underserved Market**: Targets youth and women in Ethiopia, expanding Cardano's presence in East Africa
- **Structured Approach**: Three-phase model (setup, training, showcase) with pilot workshops to refine curriculum
- **Partnership Strategy**: Collaboration with universities, women-led orgs, and youth centers ensures recruitment pipeline
- **Open Source**: All materials released under CC BY 4.0 and MIT licenses for community reuse
- **Long-term Continuity**: Includes micro-projects, Catalyst proposal training, and ongoing community groups

## Concerns
- **Team Verification**: LinkedIn profiles provided but limited evidence of prior blockchain delivery experience
- **Technical Depth**: Curriculum details are high-level; unclear how complex topics (dApps, NFTs) will be taught to absolute beginners
- **Sustainability Risk**: Continuity plan mentioned but lacks concrete funding mechanisms post-program
- **Measurement Gaps**: While wallet creation is trackable, "satisfaction rating of 75%" and "knowledge improvement" metrics need clearer methodologies
- **Budget Granularity**: Milestone costs (7,500 / 10,000 / 4,000 ADA) lack detailed line-item breakdowns for transparency

## Recommendation
**FUND** - This proposal delivers strong grassroots impact in an underserved market with clear, measurable outputs. The team has community program experience, and the budget is cost-effective for the scale of training. Risks are manageable with proper milestone verification and transparent reporting.

# Proposal Review: Cardano IdeaFest

**Proposal ID:** 1770
**Proposer:** Soraya Ponce
**Requested Funds:** 60,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 6 months
**Theme:** Events & Marketing - Hackathons

## Summary
This proposal seeks to organize Cardano IdeaFest in Ecuador, a 1-month education + ideathon program teaching 100-150 participants about blockchain, Cardano, and underutilized CF/IOG technologies (Originate, Veridian, Reeve, Hydra, Midnight), culminating in a 2-day in-person ideathon in Quito with prizes and post-event mentorship.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 4
Strong educational impact addressing real gap: awareness of Cardano Foundation tools (Originate, Veridian, Reeve) and IOG protocols (Hydra, Midnight). Progressive curriculum (blockchain basics → Cardano ecosystem → CF/IOG tech) ensures participants build foundation before advanced topics. Targets 100-150 participants (students, entrepreneurs, professionals) in Ecuador, expanding LATAM presence. Expected outputs: 10-20 high-quality ideas for Catalyst F15-16, new wallets created, partnerships with 3+ universities. Post-event support connects ideas with developers/mentors for Catalyst proposal development. Addresses legitimate criticism that CF/IOG tools are underutilized due to lack of awareness.

### Feasibility ⭐ 4
Highly feasible with experienced team. Soraya Ponce has organized 20+ Cardano events in Ecuador, supported Catalyst teams in LATAM, and served as alternate delegate at Argentina constitutional event. Emilica Calvache provides 3+ years Cardano technical support. Timeline is realistic: Month 1-2 planning + publicity (5 university visits), Month 3-4 virtual sessions + community building, Month 5-6 in-person ideathon + reporting. Budget is detailed and realistic. Contingency plan for CF/IOG speaker unavailability (Plan B: Cardano Ambassadors, SPOs, community developers) demonstrates risk management. Venue in Quito (university space) reduces costs. Main risk is CF/IOG speaker participation, but Plan B mitigates.

### Value for Money ⭐ 4
Good value at 60,000 ADA for 100-150 participants. Budget breakdown: 8,000 ADA planning + publicity, 13,000 ADA university outreach + virtual prep, 39,000 ADA event execution (includes 17,000 ADA prizes, 10,000 ADA speaker travel, 7,000 ADA venue, 5,000 ADA presentation/engagement). Cost per participant is 400-600 ADA (~$200-300), which is competitive for hybrid (virtual + in-person) program with speaker travel from international/national sources. Prizes (17,000 ADA) are substantial and incentivize quality. Budget allocation prioritizes event execution (39,000 ADA = 65% of budget), which is correct.

## Strengths
- Addresses real gap: underutilization of CF tools (Originate, Veridian, Reeve) and IOG tech (Hydra, Midnight)
- Progressive curriculum (basics → Cardano → advanced tools) ensures foundation-building
- Experienced proposer (Soraya Ponce): 20+ Cardano events in Ecuador, LATAM Catalyst support
- Contingency plan (Plan B) for CF/IOG speaker unavailability demonstrates risk management
- Hybrid format (virtual + in-person) balances accessibility and engagement
- Budget prioritizes event execution (65%) over marketing/admin
- Post-event support: connecting ideas with developers, SPOs, mentors for Catalyst proposals
- Open-source commitment (MIT/Apache 2.0 code, CC-BY 4.0 educational content)
- Clear success metrics (100-150 participants, 80%+ knowledge increase, 50-100 event attendees)

## Concerns
- Success depends on CF/IOG speaker participation (Plan B mitigates but reduces "official" endorsement)
- 10-20 ideas expected, but no guarantee these convert to funded Catalyst proposals (aspirational)
- University visits (5 planned) not confirmed with signed MOUs or agreements
- Speaker/mentor budget (14,000 ADA) includes international travel—assumes confirmed speakers
- Single inclusive challenge ("Innovating with Cardano") vs. separate track challenges may reduce focus
- No mention of post-event tracking (do ideas become proposals? are they funded?)
- Virtual session delivery platform and recording not specified
- Success metric "1,000-2,000 social reach" is low for 60,000 ADA investment
- No mention of diversity/inclusion targets (gender, non-technical participants)

## Recommendation
**FUND** - Strong educational proposal addressing legitimate underutilization of CF/IOG technologies. Experienced proposer with proven track record in Ecuador. Progressive curriculum ensures participants build foundation before tackling advanced tools. Budget is realistic and well-allocated. Contingency plan demonstrates maturity. Minor improvements: (1) secure confirmed MOUs from 3+ universities, (2) commit to tracking which ideas convert to Catalyst proposals, (3) increase social media reach targets (5,000-10,000 engagement), (4) specify virtual session platform (Zoom, StreamYard), and (5) add diversity targets (40%+ women, 30%+ non-technical participants). Overall, recommend to fund—fills important gap in ecosystem education.

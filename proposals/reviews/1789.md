# Proposal Review: DeFi Beginners Pathway: Cardano Learning Program

**Proposal ID:** 1789
**Proposer:** Erick Valadez
**Requested Funds:** 24,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 3 months
**Theme:** Education

## Summary
This proposal offers an online course in Spanish teaching DeFi from scratch and its use on Cardano. Delivered over 10 hours across 3 months, the program aims to give users confidence to interact safely with ADA and overcome language barriers limiting adoption in Spanish-speaking regions.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 3
Moderate impact potential. Spanish is the second-most spoken native language globally (475M+ speakers), making localized DeFi education strategically valuable. The proposal addresses a real barrier—lack of Spanish-language resources causes fear and limits adoption. However, impact depends heavily on reach and distribution strategy, which are not specified. How many students targeted? What marketing plan exists? "Growing interest in DeFi" is mentioned but not quantified. Impact is limited to education without clear activation mechanics (will students complete transactions, create wallets, use dApps?).

### Feasibility ⭐ 3
Feasibility is reasonable but under-documented. Creating a 10-hour online course in 3 months is achievable. The proposer (Erick Valadez) is not described—what teaching experience? What Cardano/DeFi expertise? What platform will host the course (YouTube, custom LMS, Moodle)? Who creates content (video, slides, quizzes)? The 3-month timeline suggests the course is delivered live or in cohorts rather than pre-recorded, but this is unclear. Feasibility depends on content quality and platform choice, neither detailed.

### Value for Money ⭐ 3
At 24,000 ADA for a 10-hour course, value depends on reach. If 100 students, that's 240 ADA per student (~$85-$110)—expensive for online education. If 1,000 students, it's 24 ADA per student (~$8-$11)—excellent value. Without enrollment targets or budget breakdown, assessment is difficult. Costs likely include content creation, platform hosting, marketing, and instructor time. The absence of line-item costs and student targets makes ROI unclear. Open-access courses typically cost less than 24,000 ADA unless high production value or live instruction.

## Strengths
- **Language Localization**: Spanish content addresses massive underserved market (475M+ speakers)
- **DeFi Focus**: Targets high-interest topic driving current crypto adoption
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Designed for absolute beginners, lowering entry barriers
- **Safety Emphasis**: Promises to teach safe ADA interaction, addressing key user concern
- **Modest Budget**: 24,000 ADA is mid-range for educational content
- **Online Format**: Scalable delivery without geographic limitations

## Concerns
- **No Team Information**: Proposer credentials, teaching experience, and DeFi expertise not provided
- **Missing Enrollment Target**: How many students? Success criteria unclear
- **No Distribution Plan**: How will course be marketed? What platform hosts it?
- **Activation Gap**: Does course include hands-on wallet setup, transactions, dApp use? Or just theory?
- **Budget Breakdown**: Zero line-item detail on content creation, hosting, marketing, instructor fees
- **Timeline Vagueness**: 3 months for what—creation, delivery, or both?
- **Sustainability**: Will course remain accessible after 3 months? Ongoing updates?
- **Competition**: Many free DeFi courses exist; what differentiates this one?

## Recommendation
**CONSIDER** - The proposal addresses a genuine need (Spanish DeFi education) in a large market, but lacks critical implementation details. Without team credentials, enrollment targets, activation mechanics, or budget breakdown, funding risk is moderate. The proposer should provide: (1) verifiable teaching/DeFi experience, (2) enrollment target and distribution plan, (3) course curriculum outline, (4) platform and hosting strategy, (5) itemized budget, and (6) hands-on activation components (wallet setup, live transactions). Recommend requesting detailed plan before funding.

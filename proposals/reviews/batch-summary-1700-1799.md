## Thematic Analysis

### Strongest Themes
1. **Physical Hubs/Incubators**: Vietnam Builder Hub, Indonesia University Hub score highest
2. **Education at Scale**: Nigeria High School Club, Mongolia University Tour deliver excellent value
3. **Governance/Accountability**: Catalyst audit proposal addresses critical ecosystem need
4. **Real-World Adoption**: CIP-13/99 implementations (SovaBar) demonstrate practical utility

### Weakest Themes
1. **Content/Media**: Newsletters, podcasts, video series show diminishing returns
2. **One-time Events**: Conference sponsorships lack sustainable impact
3. **Consulting/Reports**: Overpriced documents without clear ecosystem value

---

## Key Observations

### Positive Patterns
- **Venue ownership** dramatically increases feasibility scores (1722, 1760, 1794)
- **Proven track records** (12 Miles Nigeria, 5PC Vietnam) correlate with FUND recommendations
- **Pay-for-success models** (1724 crowdsourcing) maximize ROI
- **Verifiable credentials** (GitHub, LinkedIn) build reviewer confidence
- **Geographic arbitrage** enables excellent value in Vietnam, Nigeria, Indonesia

### Red Flags
- Anonymous teams with no verifiable credentials
- Vague success metrics without on-chain adoption pathways
- One-time events without sustainability plans
- Overpriced consulting deliverables
- Proposals lacking technical depth for claimed scope

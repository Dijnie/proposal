# Proposal Review: Cardano Education Hub & University Tour Mongolia

**Proposal ID:** 1722
**Proposer:** Hiisver (Temulun Khongorzul)
**Requested Funds:** 60,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 6 months
**Theme:** Community Outreach

## Summary
This proposal delivers Cardano blockchain education across 10 Mongolian universities through lectures, workshops, and hands-on demonstrations, while establishing a Cardano Education Hub to create open-source educational materials and support ongoing community development.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 4
Addresses strategic geographic gap - Mongolia has minimal Cardano presence despite young, crypto-interested population. Reaching 5,000+ students across 10 universities creates strong foundation for ecosystem growth. Success metrics are strong: 500 wallets created, 300 staking participants, 200 NFT mints - clear on-chain adoption outcomes. Hub ownership (Twin Tower 2) by project lead provides stability and sustainability. Open-source materials (CC BY 4.0) ensure lasting value beyond 6 months.

### Feasibility ⭐ 4
Team lead (Temulun Khongorzul) has verifiable 8+ years media/education experience. VISM Studio portfolio demonstrates professional content production capability. Owned office space (Twin Tower 2) eliminates venue risk - major credibility signal. University partnerships and lecture tour logistics are realistic for team with local presence. 6-month timeline is appropriate. Milestones are detailed with clear deliverables. Only minor concern: no confirmed university agreements shown yet (Milestone 1 addresses this).

### Value for Money ⭐ 4
At 60,000 ADA for 10 university lectures + 20 videos + 6-month hub operations + open-source materials, value is strong. Cost per student reached (~12 ADA or $4.80) is excellent for direct educational engagement. Budget breakdown is detailed: 22k for lecture tour, 14k for content production, 8k setup, 6k marketing - logical allocation. Owned venue eliminates rent expense, maximizing funds toward educational delivery. Content reusability (open-source) provides ongoing ecosystem value. Much better ROI than typical one-off events.

## Strengths
- **Owned venue (Twin Tower 2)** eliminates rental risk - major credibility signal
- Targets strategic geographic gap (Mongolia = untapped market)
- Strong on-chain adoption metrics (500 wallets, 300 stakers, 200 NFT mints)
- Experienced media team (VISM Studio, 8+ years) with proven portfolio
- Detailed budget breakdown with logical allocation
- Open-source materials (CC BY 4.0) provide lasting ecosystem value
- Excellent cost-efficiency (12 ADA per student reached)
- Reaches 5,000+ students directly (large potential funnel)
- Creates sustainable hub infrastructure for ongoing activities
- Clear milestones with specific acceptance criteria

## Concerns
- University partnership agreements not yet confirmed (addressed in M1)
- Team credentials are strong for project lead but education specialists lack individual verification
- Guest speaker lineup not yet confirmed
- Success measurement relies on self-reporting (wallet creation claims need verification)
- 6-month hub operation sustainability unclear post-funding
- Marketing reach target (2,000 students online) is modest relative to total student population

## Recommendation
**FUND** - This is a strong proposal with excellent strategic value. The owned venue (Twin Tower 2) demonstrates serious commitment and eliminates major risk factor. Reaching 5,000 Mongolian students at 12 ADA per student with verifiable on-chain outcomes (wallet creation, staking) is outstanding value-for-money. Team lead has verifiable credentials and local infrastructure. Open-source educational materials provide ecosystem-wide benefit. Mongolia represents greenfield opportunity for Cardano ecosystem expansion. This is exactly the type of regional community-building that drives long-term adoption. Minor risks (university confirmations pending) are addressed in milestone structure. **Highly recommended for funding.**

# Proposal Review: Indonesia CAR-dano: University Mobility Hub

**Proposal ID:** 1791
**Proposer:** PT Inspeksi Mobil Jogja (PALAPA)
**Requested Funds:** 15,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 6 months
**Theme:** Events

## Summary
Building on Indonesia CAR-dano Fund13, this proposal creates a campus mobility RWA pipeline using real vehicle inspection data to help Indonesian university teams build practical Cardano prototypes, focusing on governance, data literacy, and RWA education.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 4
Strong academic impact. The proposal targets Indonesian universities (one of Asia's largest higher-education markets) where Cardano currently has minimal presence. By anchoring RWA education in real automotive data and academic institutions, the project creates a sustainable talent pipeline. Targeting 150+ students/faculty across 3+ universities with hands-on governance and RWA demos provides measurable reach. The emphasis on open-access materials enables replication across Indonesia and globally. Long-term value includes thesis research, student innovation projects, and future builders.

### Feasibility ⭐ 5
Excellent feasibility. PT Inspeksi Mobil Jogja successfully delivered Indonesia CAR-dano Fund13, demonstrating proven capability. Partnership with Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) provides institutional credibility and academic validation. The team includes Associate Professor Ir. Noor Akhmad Setiawan (UGM blockchain expert), ensuring curriculum quality. The proposal uses existing inspection data and governance tools rather than building new infrastructure. The 6-month timeline with clear milestones (curriculum setup, workshops, materials publication, final report) is realistic and well-structured.

### Value for Money ⭐ 5
Outstanding value. At 15,000 ADA for 150+ participants across 3 universities, this equates to ~100 ADA per student (~$35-$45)—extremely cost-effective for academic programming. Budget allocation is transparent: 45% events delivery, 20% content production, 15% outreach, 10% reporting, 10% management. The project produces reusable open-access materials (slides, templates, research kits) that extend impact beyond the immediate cohort. Low-cost, high-volume engagement with academic multiplier effects (courses, research, student clubs).

## Strengths
- **Proven Team**: Successfully completed Fund13 CAR-dano, demonstrating delivery capability
- **University Partnership**: UGM collaboration provides credibility and institutional access
- **Academic Expert**: Associate Professor Setiawan (UGM blockchain expert) validates curriculum quality
- **Real-World Data**: Uses actual automotive inspection records, making RWA tangible
- **Open Access**: All materials published openly (GitHub) for global reuse under permissive licenses
- **Scalable Model**: Curriculum and templates enable other universities to replicate independently
- **Clear Milestones**: 4-phase structure (partnership, sessions, materials, report) with specific deliverables
- **Exceptional Value**: 15,000 ADA for 150+ participants across 3 universities

## Concerns
- **Limited Technical Depth**: Workshops focus on awareness/demos rather than hands-on smart contract development
- **Governance Complexity**: Teaching Cardano governance to students without wallets/ADA may be abstract
- **Follow-Through Risk**: Will students continue engagement after workshops? Retention plan unclear
- **Metric Ambiguity**: "50%+ participants expressing interest" is soft; wallet creation or on-chain activity more concrete
- **Geographic Concentration**: All in Indonesia; could expand to other Southeast Asian countries for greater reach

## Recommendation
**FUND** - This proposal delivers excellent value through proven team, strong university partnership, and cost-effective academic anchoring. The combination of Fund13 track record, UGM collaboration, open-access materials, and RWA focus makes this a low-risk, high-impact investment. The project establishes Cardano in Indonesian academic infrastructure, creating long-term talent pipelines. Budget is transparent and exceptionally efficient.

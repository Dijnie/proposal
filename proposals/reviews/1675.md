| **Average** | **4.3/5** | **GOOD** |

## Impact Review (4/5 Stars)
**Rating**: GOOD

**Strengths:**
- Massive scale: 5,000 high school students in underserved rural areas
- Addresses real problem: limited tech education access in rural Nigeria
- Creates long-term talent pipeline for Cardano ecosystem
- Curriculum localization to mother tongue increases accessibility
- Conference and Quizathon creates engagement milestone

**Weaknesses:**
- High school students are years from becoming active ecosystem contributors
- Blockchain literacy at high school level is foundational, not technical
- Long-term adoption tracking mechanisms not detailed

## Feasibility Review (4/5 Stars)
**Rating**: GOOD

**Strengths:**
- 12 Miles organization has trained 11,000+ students since 2020
- Prior Catalyst project (1300167) successfully trained 5,000+ students
- TVC News coverage validates program credibility
- Team of 5 with clear roles (Project Lead, Curriculum, Tech, Evaluation, Community)
- Strong local partnerships with schools and education authorities

**Weaknesses:**
- Reaching 5,000 students in 8 months is ambitious (625/month)
- Ongoing project (1300167) may create capacity constraints
- Rural infrastructure challenges (internet, devices) not addressed

## Value for Money Review (5/5 Stars)
**Rating**: GREAT

**Strengths:**
- Exceptional cost efficiency: ~10 ADA per student reached
- Curriculum development (14,000 ADA) includes translation and peer review
- Implementation (25,000 ADA) reaches 10+ schools with materials
- Conference/Quizathon (13,000 ADA) engages 800+ students
- Leverages existing infrastructure and relationships

**Weaknesses:**
- Equipment costs not included (relies on existing school resources)
- Contingency buffer not explicitly allocated

## Overall Assessment

This proposal from 12 Miles demonstrates exceptional value for money in blockchain education at scale. The organization's track record of training 11,000+ students since 2020, including 5,000+ through the current Catalyst-funded project, provides strong evidence of execution capability.

The scale of reaching 5,000 high school students at approximately 10 ADA per student is remarkable efficiency. The curriculum design includes important elements: peer review by 3 educators and 2 blockchain professionals, pilot testing in 3 schools, and translation to local languages.

The Conference and Quizathon milestone creates an engaging capstone experience that celebrates learning while creating community visibility. The team structure with dedicated roles for curriculum, technology, evaluation, and community engagement shows thoughtful organization.

Key considerations: The ongoing project (1300167) may create resource competition. The foundational nature of high school blockchain education means impact on ecosystem building is long-term rather than immediate. Rural infrastructure challenges (connectivity, devices) aren't explicitly addressed.

Overall, this is a high-impact, cost-efficient proposal that creates a pipeline for future Cardano ecosystem participants while delivering immediate educational value to underserved communities.

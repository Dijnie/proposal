# Proposal Review: Cardano Green Energy Data Registry

**Proposal ID:** 1754
**Proposer:** Sarah Okonkwo
**Requested Funds:** 60,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 8 months
**Theme:** Sustainability - Real World Assets

## Summary
This proposal aims to build a blockchain-based registry for tracking renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon credits in Nigeria, using Cardano for immutable verification, tokenization of energy assets, and transparency in green energy markets.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 4
Strong real-world impact potential. Addresses transparency and fraud issues in African renewable energy markets by creating immutable registry for RECs and carbon credits. Targets 50+ energy producers and 100+ verifiable energy assets in Nigeria. Aligns with Cardano's sustainability mission and showcases blockchain utility in climate action. If successful, creates replicable model for other African countries. Clear value proposition: reduce fraud, enable fractional ownership of green assets, and increase investor confidence.

### Feasibility ⭐ 3
Moderate feasibility with regulatory and partnership risks. Team lead Sarah Okonkwo has sustainability consulting background but limited blockchain development experience. Team includes environmental analyst and blockchain developer, but developer credentials are not detailed. Proposal mentions partnerships with Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and renewable energy cooperatives, but no signed agreements provided. Regulatory framework for tokenizing energy assets in Nigeria is unclear. Technical architecture (metadata standards, oracle integration for energy data, smart contracts) is mentioned but not detailed. 8-month timeline is reasonable if partnerships are already in place.

### Value for Money ⭐ 4
60,000 ADA for real-world asset tokenization with clear impact is good value. Budget breakdown: 25,000 ADA technical development (smart contracts, metadata standards, platform), 15,000 ADA partnerships + regulatory compliance, 10,000 ADA onboarding energy producers, 10,000 ADA coordination. Allocation is sensible with majority toward technical work and partnership building. If proposal delivers 100 tokenized assets and 50 producers, cost per asset is reasonable. Value depends on regulatory approvals and producer adoption.

## Strengths
- Addresses real problem (fraud, opacity) in African green energy markets
- Clear use case for Cardano's native asset capabilities and metadata standards
- Strong alignment with Cardano's sustainability mission
- Realistic metrics (50 producers, 100 assets)
- Budget prioritizes technical development and regulatory compliance
- Replicable model for other countries
- Team includes environmental domain expertise

## Concerns
- No confirmed partnerships with NERC or energy cooperatives (MOUs required)
- Regulatory pathway for tokenizing energy assets in Nigeria unclear
- Blockchain developer credentials not detailed (no GitHub, past projects)
- Oracle integration for real-time energy data not specified
- Sustainability model unclear: how does registry fund itself post-Catalyst?
- No pilot program or POC with 5-10 producers to validate approach
- Success depends on producer adoption, which requires significant education/incentives
- Metadata standards for RECs not specified (existing standards like I-REC?)
- No mention of interoperability with global carbon credit registries

## Recommendation
**CONSIDER** - High-impact concept addressing real sustainability challenge, but execution risk due to regulatory and partnership uncertainties. Recommend funding if proposer can provide: (1) signed MOU or letter of support from NERC or major energy cooperative, (2) detailed technical architecture with metadata standards and oracle solution, (3) blockchain developer portfolio, (4) regulatory compliance roadmap, and (5) pilot with 5-10 producers demonstrating feasibility. Strong concept; needs de-risking.

# Proposal Review: Blockchain Mobility Media – Indonesia

**Proposal ID:** 1774
**Proposer:** PT Inspeksi Mobil Jogja (PALAPA Inspeksi)/ CAR-dano v1
**Requested Funds:** 15,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** Unknown (not specified in extracted data)
**Theme:** Education

## Summary
This proposal seeks to create structured e-learning modules and infographics in Bahasa Indonesia and Javanese, using real automotive workflows to explain how Cardano and CAR-dano v1 solve trust issues in Indonesia's used-car market through RWA and governance transparency.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 3
The proposal addresses a real market need (trust in used-car transactions) and localizes Cardano education to Indonesia's largest languages. However, impact is limited to educational content creation without clear onboarding or activation metrics. The connection between media content and actual Cardano adoption is indirect. Success depends on viewership and engagement, which are not specified.

### Feasibility ⭐ 4
The team has proven delivery capability through Indonesia CAR-dano Fund13 project, demonstrating experience with automotive RWA on Cardano. Creating educational content is lower-risk than technical development. However, the proposal lacks detail on content distribution strategy, platform hosting, and measurement frameworks. Timeline is not specified in extracted data.

### Value for Money ⭐ 3
At 15,000 ADA, this is a modest request for educational content production. However, without knowing the number of modules, video lengths, or distribution reach targets, it's difficult to assess ROI. The budget appears reasonable for localized media production, but lack of granular breakdown and success metrics (views, engagement, conversions) limits value assessment.

## Strengths
- **Proven Team**: PT Inspeksi Mobil Jogja delivered Indonesia CAR-dano Fund13, showing track record
- **Localization**: Content in Bahasa Indonesia and Javanese reaches underserved linguistic markets
- **Real-World Relevance**: Uses automotive workflows to make blockchain tangible and relatable
- **Modest Budget**: 15,000 ADA is conservative for educational content creation
- **Niche Focus**: Connects Cardano RWA narrative to everyday consumer problem (used-car trust)

## Concerns
- **Incomplete Proposal Data**: Timeline and detailed milestones not available in extracted information
- **Impact Measurement**: No clear KPIs for viewership, engagement, or conversion to Cardano users
- **Distribution Strategy**: Unclear how content will be promoted and where it will be hosted
- **Indirect Adoption**: Educational content alone doesn't guarantee wallet creation or on-chain activity
- **Budget Breakdown**: No line-item costs for production, design, voice-over, hosting, marketing
- **Sustainability**: No plan for content updates or ongoing maintenance

## Recommendation
**CONSIDER** - The proposal leverages a proven team and addresses localized education needs, but lacks sufficient detail on distribution, measurement, and conversion strategy. Impact would be stronger if coupled with activation mechanics (workshops, wallet onboarding). Recommend requesting detailed KPIs and distribution plan before funding.

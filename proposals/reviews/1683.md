## Feasibility Review (4/5 Stars)
**Rating**: GOOD

**Strengths:**
- HBA (Ho Chi Minh City Blockchain Association) is official government-recognized organization
- Mr. Tran Xuan Tien: 8 years journalism, General Secretary of HBA
- Mr. Bui Quang Tinh Tu: CEO Conversion Asia, TEDx Speaker, 10+ years marketing
- Partnership with Cardano Vietnam for technical training
- Prior track record: organized "Conviction" (30,000 attendees), Unitour series

**Weaknesses:**
- 9-month timeline for 5 club establishments is aggressive
- Milestone 4 has 0 ADA cost but requires close-out deliverables
- Cardano Vietnam partnership details not formalized in proposal

## Value for Money Review (3/5 Stars)
**Rating**: ACCEPTABLE

**Strengths:**
- Communication costs (45,000 ADA) leverage HBA's media network
- Budget based on realistic ADA price ($0.40)
- Detailed spreadsheet breakdown provided via Google link
- Project management (5,000 ADA) is reasonable 8%

**Weaknesses:**
- 75% of budget (45,000 ADA) allocated to Communication/PR
- Production/printing only 2,000 ADA despite physical club materials needed
- Total projected cost ($29,000) exceeds Catalyst funding - requires additional sources
- Milestone 4 shows 0 ADA but deliverables still required

## Overall Assessment

This proposal from the Ho Chi Minh City Blockchain Association (HBA) leverages strong institutional positioning to establish university-based blockchain clubs. HBA's government recognition under the HCMC Electronic Media Association provides unique legitimacy.

The team credentials are strong: General Secretary with 8 years journalism experience, CEO of marketing firm, and partnership with Cardano Vietnam for technical content. Prior events like "Conviction" (30,000 attendees) demonstrate execution capacity.

Key concerns: The budget heavily favors communication/PR (75%) over physical club infrastructure. The title claims "10 universities" but deliverables specify only 5 clubs - this discrepancy needs clarification. Milestone 4 shows 0 ADA allocation despite requiring final deliverables.

The 1M+ media reach target is ambitious but achievable given HBA's mainstream media connections. The 800+ NFT certificate target creates on-chain activity, though this represents relatively basic engagement.

Overall, this proposal offers legitimate institutional access and media reach, but the budget allocation toward PR over club infrastructure and the title/deliverable mismatch warrant attention.

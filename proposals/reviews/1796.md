# Proposal Review: OncoChain – turning Cancer Research into On-Chain Action

**Proposal ID:** 1796
**Proposer:** Dandeu Leonardo, PhD
**Requested Funds:** 45,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 6 months
**Theme:** Healthcare

## Summary
OncoChain connects cancer researchers with Cardano/blockchain through educational sessions, expert interviews, and co-creation workshops to develop 3 Cardano use cases in oncology, publishing findings as an open-access report.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 4
Strong strategic impact. The proposal addresses DeSci (Decentralized Science), a high-priority narrative for Cardano. Connecting medical researchers (oncology) to blockchain creates credible, real-world use case development. The team lead is a PhD hematologist and breast cancer researcher, providing domain expertise and network access. Three co-created use cases with researchers could demonstrate Cardano's applicability in medical data, research funding, or clinical trials. Open-access publication enables broader academic/industry adoption. The Argentina-based team expands Cardano's Latin American DeSci presence.

### Feasibility ⭐ 4
Good feasibility. Leonardo Dandeu successfully completed DeSci Quark (Fund13, ID 1300094), demonstrating delivery capability in DeSci domain. Team includes Nerina Ermacora for project support. The proposal leverages existing researcher networks through Leonardo's oncology background. Deliverables are clear: 3 educational sessions, 10 expert interviews, 3 Cardano use cases, final report. The 6-month timeline is realistic for educational/research activities. Main risk is whether cancer researchers will genuinely engage vs. passive participation—success depends on Leonardo's network strength and facilitation skills.

### Value for Money ⭐ 3
Moderate value. At 45,000 ADA, the budget seems high for 3 educational sessions, 10 interviews, and 3 use case concepts (not implementations). This equates to ~15,000 ADA per use case (~$5,250-$6,750) for conceptual development, not technical building. Budget breakdown is not provided, so allocation between sessions, interviews, documentation, and team compensation is unclear. The open-access report adds value for ecosystem-wide benefit. Value depends on whether use cases lead to actual implementations post-project—if they remain conceptual, ROI is limited.

## Strengths
- **DeSci Focus**: Addresses high-priority Cardano narrative (decentralized science)
- **Domain Expertise**: Leonardo Dandeu is PhD hematologist and breast cancer researcher
- **Proven Delivery**: Team completed DeSci Quark (Fund13) successfully
- **Research Network**: Direct access to oncology researchers through Leonardo's professional connections
- **Co-Creation Model**: Researchers actively involved in use case design, ensuring relevance
- **Open Access**: Final report publicly available for broader ecosystem benefit
- **Geographic Diversity**: Argentina-based team expands Latin American DeSci presence
- **Clear Deliverables**: 3 sessions, 10 interviews, 3 use cases, final report—all measurable

## Concerns
- **No Budget Breakdown**: 45,000 ADA allocation between activities and team compensation unclear
- **Conceptual vs. Implementation**: Use cases are designed, not built—limited on-chain activity
- **High Cost Per Use Case**: ~15,000 ADA per use case concept (not MVP) seems expensive
- **Researcher Engagement Risk**: Will cancer researchers genuinely engage or provide token participation?
- **No Technical Team**: Proposal focuses on education/research; no developers to prototype use cases
- **Sustainability**: What happens after 6 months? Will use cases be implemented or remain conceptual?
- **Impact Measurement**: How will "success" of use cases be evaluated? Adoption metrics unclear
- **Limited Team Information**: Only 2 team members mentioned; roles and time commitments vague

## Recommendation
**CONSIDER** - The proposal addresses DeSci strategically with credible domain expertise and proven Fund13 delivery, but the 45,000 ADA budget for conceptual use case development (no implementation) raises value concerns. The project's strength is connecting researchers to Cardano, but without technical prototyping or clear implementation pathways, impact remains speculative. Recommend requesting: (1) detailed budget breakdown, (2) plans for use case prototyping or pilot implementations, (3) expanded team with technical capability, and (4) clear metrics for researcher engagement and use case viability. Consider funding at reduced amount or requiring technical proof-of-concept deliverables.

# Proposal Review: [MIDN] Hydra Scaling to Midnight Privacy - For The Masses

**Proposal ID:** 1793
**Proposer:** Hoan Le
**Requested Funds:** 45,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 3 months
**Theme:** Social Media

## Summary
This proposal uses AI-accelerated video production to adapt "Cardano For The Masses" content into 45 viral short-form videos (2-3 minutes each) for TikTok and YouTube, featuring an AI presenter to educate the next billion users about Cardano's evolution from Hydra to Midnight.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 3
Moderate impact potential. TikTok is a powerful distribution platform with massive reach, especially for Gen Z and emerging markets. Creating 45 educational videos in Vietnamese about Hydra and Midnight addresses language barriers. However, impact depends heavily on virality and engagement, which are unpredictable. The proposal mentions "massive existing community channels" (Telegram 3k, X 39k) but these are modest compared to TikTok's scale. Educational videos alone don't guarantee wallet creation or on-chain activity. Success metrics focus on production output rather than conversion to active users.

### Feasibility ⭐ 4
Good feasibility. The team has relevant experience: Nguyen Tuan Anh created viral crypto content for 4 years, and Hoan Le has FPT technical background. Using AI tools (HeyGen, ElevenLabs, etc.) to automate video production is cost-effective and scalable. Producing 45 short videos in 3 months (15 per month) is ambitious but achievable with AI acceleration. The team leverages translation from existing "Cardano For The Masses" content (Fund11), avoiding content creation from scratch. Main risk is whether AI-generated videos achieve "viral" quality—lip-sync, graphics, and storytelling must be polished to compete on TikTok.

### Value for Money ⭐ 2
Value concerns exist. At 45,000 ADA for 45 videos, this is 1,000 ADA per video (~$350-$450). Traditional animated video costs $2,000-$7,000 per minute, so AI automation provides savings. However, 2-3 minute AI videos at $350-$450 each seem high compared to other AI content projects. Budget breakdown shows heavy costs (30% in Milestone 1 for AI tools setup) but lacks granular line-items. The main issue is ROI uncertainty—views and engagement are unpredictable, and educational content doesn't guarantee user activation. Without conversion metrics (wallet downloads, ADA purchases), value is difficult to justify.

## Strengths
- **AI Innovation**: Pioneering use of AI tools for Cardano education at scale
- **Viral Platform**: TikTok has massive reach potential, especially for younger demographics
- **Language Localization**: Vietnamese content serves underserved market
- **Existing Content**: Leverages "Cardano For The Masses" translation from Fund11
- **Experienced Creator**: Nguyen Tuan Anh has 4-year track record creating viral crypto content
- **Community Distribution**: Existing channels (Telegram, X, YouTube) provide initial distribution
- **Open Source**: AI scripts and automation processes will be publicly disclosed

## Concerns
- **High Cost**: 1,000 ADA per 2-3 minute video seems expensive even with AI automation
- **Viral Uncertainty**: No guarantee videos will achieve significant reach or engagement
- **Activation Gap**: Educational videos don't necessarily convert viewers to wallet users or on-chain participants
- **Budget Heavy Front-Loading**: 15,000 ADA in Month 1 for AI tools seems high
- **Metrics Focus on Output**: Success measured by video production, not user conversion
- **Technical Complexity**: Hydra/Midnight are advanced topics; 2-3 minutes may oversimplify
- **Platform Risk**: TikTok algorithm changes or geo-restrictions could limit reach

## Recommendation
**CONSIDER** - The proposal innovatively applies AI to Cardano education and targets TikTok's massive reach, but value justification is weak. At 45,000 ADA, the cost per video is high, and success depends on unpredictable virality without clear conversion metrics. The team has relevant experience, but budget breakdown lacks granularity. Recommend requesting: (1) detailed line-item budget, (2) clear engagement targets (views, likes, shares), (3) activation metrics (wallet downloads, website visits), and (4) cost comparison with alternative approaches. Consider funding at reduced amount or requiring milestone-based release tied to verifiable engagement KPIs.

## Scoring Summary (1-5 Stars)

| Dimension | Stars | Rating |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Impact | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5) | GOOD |

| Value for Money | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5) | GOOD |
| **Average** | **4.0/5** | **GOOD** |

## Impact Review (4/5 Stars)
**Rating**: GOOD

**Strengths:**
- Targets real gap: Vietnam has strong Web3 potential but limited Cardano builder infrastructure
- 7-day intensive bootcamp with 1:1 mentoring is high-touch approach
- Ambitious goal: 10 teams participating, 5+ projects to Mainnet
- Workshops cover full stack: Business Model, Marketing, Product-Market Fit, Web3 Legal
- Creates pipeline from hackathon ideas to deployable products

**Weaknesses:**
- 5 Mainnet projects from 10 teams (50%) is ambitious
- 4-month timeline includes only 1 week of actual bootcamp
- Long-term sustainability of deployed projects not addressed

## Feasibility Review (4/5 Stars)
**Rating**: GOOD

**Strengths:**
- Blockchain Pioneer Student Club has 50+ members
- Strong Catalyst track record: funded in Fund 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Prior events: "Cardano Blockchain Hackathon 2025", "Vietnam University Cardano Workshop Series"
- Team includes experienced leads (President 3+ years Cardano experience)
- University student club structure provides institutional support

**Weaknesses:**
- 7-day bootcamp is short for "Zero to Mainnet" goal
- Selection of 10 teams from 150 builders needs rigorous criteria
- Technical mentor capacity not detailed

## Value for Money Review (4/5 Stars)
**Rating**: GOOD

**Strengths:**
- Clear budget breakdown by category
- Rewards for top teams (10,000 ADA) incentivizes quality
- Venue costs (15,000 ADA) appropriate for intensive in-person event
- Cost per Mainnet project (~12,000 ADA) is efficient if targets met
- Food support (5,000 ADA) enables full-day participation

**Weaknesses:**
- 60,000 ADA maximum request for 4-month project
- Management (10,000 ADA) is 17% of budget
- Success depends heavily on team selection quality
- Media publications/merch (5,000 ADA) purpose unclear

## Overall Assessment

This proposal from Blockchain Pioneer Student Club (BPS) offers an intensive, results-focused approach to Cardano builder development in Vietnam. The team's strong Catalyst track record (funded in Funds 10-14) and prior event experience (hackathons, workshop series) demonstrates execution capability.

The 7-day bootcamp model with daily 1:1 mentoring and parallel workshops (Business Model, Marketing, Product-Market Fit, Web3 Legal) addresses the full spectrum of startup needs. The ambitious target of deploying 5+ projects to Mainnet from 10 teams creates strong accountability.

Key considerations: The screening process selecting 10 teams from 150+ builders is critical to success. The 7-day intensive format is short for "Zero to Mainnet" outcomes, requiring participants to arrive with substantial preparation. The budget allocation is reasonable, though the 17% management cost and unclear merch/media allocation warrant attention.

Overall, this is a well-structured proposal that leverages existing institutional infrastructure (university club) and proven event experience to address Vietnam's Cardano builder gap.

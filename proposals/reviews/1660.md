| Dimension | Stars | Rating |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Impact | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5) | ACCEPTABLE |
| Feasibility | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5) | ACCEPTABLE |
| Value for Money | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5) | ACCEPTABLE |
| **Average** | **3.0/5** | **ACCEPTABLE** |

## Impact Review (3/5 Stars)
**Rating**: ACCEPTABLE

**Strengths:**
- Addresses real problem: many Cardano projects lack professional design
- Targets early-stage businesses who can't afford design services
- 15 projects supported creates meaningful ecosystem improvement
- Article summarizing common UX/branding issues is valuable public good
- Before/after comparisons provide transparency

**Weaknesses:**
- Impact limited to 15 projects over 4 months
- Selection criteria for beneficiary projects not specified
- Unclear how projects will be prioritized (first-come vs merit-based)
- No sustainability plan for continued design support

## Feasibility Review (3/5 Stars)
**Rating**: ACCEPTABLE

**Strengths:**
- Thyme Studio has 7 years professional design experience
- Freelancing in crypto/Web3 since 2020 with Cardano focus
- Portfolio available at thymestudio.co
- 4-month timeline is reasonable for scope
- Monthly milestones provide accountability

**Weaknesses:**
- Solo designer for 8 audits + 3 UI/UX audits + 3 branding packages + 1 website
- High workload risk: ~4 deliverables per month
- No mention of prior Catalyst project experience
- Client coordination complexity not addressed

## Value for Money Review (3/5 Stars)
**Rating**: ACCEPTABLE

**Strengths:**
- Design services: 40,000 ADA (80%) is core spend
- Branding audits at 2,000 ADA each is reasonable market rate
- Website/app design at 6,000 ADA is competitive
- Detailed breakdown by service type provided

**Weaknesses:**
- 50,000 ADA for 15 projects = ~3,333 ADA/project average
- Project management (5,000 ADA, 10%) is high for solo designer
- Some projects (branding audits) deliver recommendations only, not implementation
- Open source status vague ("where applicable")

## Overall Assessment

This proposal offers direct, tangible value to Cardano projects needing professional design help. ThymeStudio's 7 years of design experience and Cardano-specific focus since 2020 provides relevant expertise.

The service mix is practical: 8 branding audits, 3 UI/UX audits, 3 branding packages, and 1 full website/app design. The commitment to publish before/after comparisons and a summary article on common UX issues adds public good value.

However, the proposal has notable gaps. Project selection criteria aren't specified - how will 15 projects be chosen from applicants? The solo designer model creates execution risk given the workload. Additionally, branding audits deliver recommendations but not implementation, which may limit realized impact.

The budget is reasonable for professional design services, though the 10% project management allocation seems high for a solo operation. Overall, this is a straightforward service proposal that would benefit from clearer selection criteria and potentially a smaller scope or additional team members.

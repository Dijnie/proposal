# Proposal Review: 120+ Open Outputs: Crowdsourcing Dev, Research and Marketing

**Proposal ID:** 1724
**Proposer:** Do Hoang Trung
**Requested Funds:** 60,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 6 months
**Theme:** Community

## Summary
This proposal runs 12 monthly challenges across Development, Research, and Marketing tracks, crowdsourcing solutions from 500+ builders to deliver 120+ open-source outputs (SDKs, reports, content) using a pay-for-success bounty model.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 5
**Exceptional value proposition**. Converts 60k ADA into 120+ finished products (~500 ADA per output) - outstanding ROI. Addresses multiple ecosystem gaps simultaneously: IoT SDK, RWA standards, Bridge architecture, Governance reports, DeFi analysis, Marketing content. Crowdsourcing model de-risks single-team dependency. Engages 500+ builders (talent retention during bear market). All outputs open-source with permanent ecosystem value. Success metrics are ambitious but specific: 40 dev tools, 40 research reports, 40 creative assets.

### Feasibility ⭐ 4
Team has strong relevant experience: Do Hoang Trung (2+ years Hackathon organizing, full-stack + Plutus/Aiken dev), Bui Huong Giang (community management, B2B partnerships), Phung Nguyen Trong An (Cardano dev with GitHub/LinkedIn verification). Verifiable credentials provided. Challenge operation process is well-defined (rubrics, anti-plagiarism, GitHub commit verification). 6-month timeline with monthly cycles is realistic. Multisig fund management shows accountability. Minor concern: Judge panel not yet confirmed, but recruitment plan is clear.

### Value for Money ⭐ 5
**Outstanding value**. 67% of budget (40k ADA) goes directly to community builders as bounties - maximum ecosystem impact. Operational costs minimal (9k project lead, 4.8k community ops, 2.7k judges = 16.5k governance). Average 500 ADA (~$200) per high-quality output is significantly cheaper than hiring teams. Open-source licensing means ROI compounds indefinitely (reusable SDKs, research, content). Compare to typical 60k single-team proposals delivering 1-2 outputs - this delivers 120+. Transparent multisig management. Pay-for-success model eliminates risk of funding promises without delivery.

## Strengths
- **120+ open-source outputs for 60k ADA** - exceptional ROI (~500 ADA each)
- Pay-for-success model = zero risk of funding unfulfilled promises
- Addresses multiple ecosystem gaps (Dev, Research, Marketing) simultaneously
- Verifiable team credentials (GitHub, LinkedIn provided)
- Crowdsourcing de-risks single-team dependency
- 67% budget to community builders (maximum direct impact)
- Multisig wallet management (accountability + transparency)
- Anti-gaming mechanisms (GitHub commit history, plagiarism checks)
- Engages 500+ builders (talent retention, ecosystem activation)
- Clear success metrics (40 dev/40 research/40 marketing outputs)
- Transparent scoring rubrics published pre-challenge
- Open-source library creates permanent ecosystem asset

## Concerns
- Judge panel not yet confirmed (recruitment in progress)
- Challenge quality depends on judge expertise (risk if judges lack domain depth)
- 120 outputs in 6 months is ambitious (assumes consistent participation)
- No contingency if participation is lower than expected (500 builders)
- Milestone structure lumps multiple challenges together (harder to track granularly)
- Some challenge topics very complex (IoT SDK, Bridge architecture) - can bounties attract sufficient expertise?

## Recommendation
**FUND** - This is an exemplary proposal showcasing how Catalyst should operate. The crowdsourcing + pay-for-success model maximizes ROI while minimizing risk. At 500 ADA per open-source output (vs. typical 60k for single deliverable), this is 100x+ more cost-efficient than traditional funding. Team has verifiable credentials and proven event management experience. Multisig transparency and anti-gaming mechanisms demonstrate accountability. Addresses multiple critical ecosystem gaps (IoT, RWA, Bridges, Governance, DeFi research) that would cost 10x+ if funded as separate proposals. **Strongly recommended - this is exactly the type of high-leverage, community-empowering project Catalyst needs.**

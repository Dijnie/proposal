# Proposal Review: Company Setup Structure - Risk Assessment Report

**Proposal ID:** 1727
**Proposer:** Hansraj Jangir
**Requested Funds:** 60,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** 3 months
**Theme:** Business Services

## Summary
This proposal creates educational materials explaining various legal entity structures for crypto projects, their pros/cons, risk factors, and impact on tokens to help Cardano projects make informed organizational setup decisions.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 2
Addresses a real but niche issue - project legal structuring is important but affects primarily project founders, not end users or developers. Educational materials on entity structures have limited direct impact on ecosystem growth, adoption, or technical innovation. Success metrics are vague ("proper identification of relevant company structure") without measurable adoption (how many projects use this? Does it change behavior?). Content may be generic rather than Cardano-specific. Unclear if community demand exists for this specific resource.

### Feasibility ⭐ 3
Proposer (Hansraj Jangir) has strong relevant credentials - 10+ years as Chartered Accountant specializing in IFRS, financial reporting, and technical accounting. LinkedIn provided. Expertise is verifiable and directly applicable. However, team is essentially solo (mentions "copywriter" in budget but no credentials). 3-month timeline is realistic for research + documentation. Milestones are simplistic (research → write → close-out) without clear validation of content quality. No mention of legal review (critical for entity structure advice).

### Value for Money ⭐ 1
**Very poor value**. 60,000 ADA for essentially 2 educational documents (single-entity structures + group structures) is excessive. Budget breakdown: 10,500 ADA (3 x 3,500) for "Project Lead" + 3,000 ADA for "Project Advisor" + minimal copywriter costs = ~49,500 ADA for ~3 months of research/writing work. This equates to ~$19,800 for educational content that could be produced for fraction of cost. Comparable research reports funded at 10-15k ADA. No specialized software, no legal review costs, no external consultants - just one person's time. At 20k ADA/document, this is 10x overpriced.

## Strengths
- Proposer has strong, verifiable credentials (10+ years Chartered Accountant)
- Legal entity structuring is legitimately important for projects
- Open-source commitment (freely accessible materials)
- LinkedIn profile provided for verification
- Relevant expertise in financial reporting, IFRS, compliance

## Concerns
- **CRITICAL: Massively overpriced** - 60k ADA for 2 documents is 10x typical cost
- Impact is limited (affects founders, not ecosystem broadly)
- Solo team (only proposer has credentials, copywriter unnamed)
- No legal review mentioned (essential for entity structure advice)
- Generic content risk (may not be Cardano-specific)
- Success metrics are vague (no measurable adoption/usage tracking)
- No evidence of community demand for this specific resource
- Content may become outdated quickly (regulatory changes)
- Milestone structure is simplistic (research → write → done)
- Budget justification is weak ("financial prudency" doesn't explain 60k for 3-month writing project)
- No comparable cost analysis (similar reports cost 10-15k ADA)

## Recommendation
**DO NOT FUND** - While legal entity structuring is important, this proposal is grossly overpriced at 60,000 ADA for what amounts to 2 educational documents produced by one person over 3 months. Comparable research/educational content in Catalyst is funded at 10-15k ADA range. The budget breakdown reveals ~16,500 ADA per month for "Project Lead" (~$6,600/month) which is excessive for research and writing work. No legal review, no external consultants, no specialized costs justify this budget. **Alternative recommendation**: This work could deliver value at 15,000-20,000 ADA budget. At current price, community should reject and encourage resubmission at realistic cost.

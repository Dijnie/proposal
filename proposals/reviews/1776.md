# Proposal Review: Indonesia CAR-dano: Automotive RWA Deployment Program

**Proposal ID:** 1776
**Proposer:** PT Inspeksi Mobil Jogja (PALAPA)
**Requested Funds:** 20,000 ADA
**Project Duration:** Unknown (not specified in extracted data)
**Theme:** Events

## Summary
Building on Indonesia CAR-dano Fund13, this proposal aims to run on-site workshops and roadshows to mint vehicle inspection data on Cardano, giving students, buyers, and dealers hands-on experience with real-world asset (RWA) use cases in Indonesia's automotive sector.

## Scores

### Impact ⭐ 4
Strong practical impact through field activation. Moving from proof-of-concept (Fund13) to real market deployment is the logical next step for RWA adoption. Engaging students, car buyers, and dealers creates diverse user touchpoints. Minting real vehicle inspection data on-chain provides tangible, verifiable utility. This directly demonstrates Cardano's RWA capabilities in a relatable industry. Impact is measurable through on-chain mints and participant engagement.

### Feasibility ⭐ 5
Excellent feasibility. PT Inspeksi Mobil Jogja successfully completed Indonesia CAR-dano Fund13, proving they can deliver automotive RWA on Cardano. The team has existing infrastructure (inspection business), real data, and local market access. Workshops and roadshows are lower-risk activities compared to technical development. The proposal leverages proven systems rather than building from scratch. Prior Catalyst success significantly de-risks execution.

### Value for Money ⭐ 4
At 20,000 ADA, this is a cost-effective deployment program. Workshops and roadshows are relatively low-cost activities, and the team already has infrastructure in place. Budget seems reasonable for venue rentals, materials, travel, and facilitator time. ROI is strong if the program generates real marketplace adoption of on-chain inspection certificates. The main value is market validation and user activation, not just education.

## Strengths
- **Proven Delivery**: Team successfully completed Fund13 CAR-dano, demonstrating capability
- **Real RWA Use Case**: Vehicle inspection certificates are tangible, valuable assets
- **Market Access**: Team operates automotive inspection business with direct dealer/buyer connections
- **Field Activation**: On-site workshops and roadshows bring Cardano directly to end users
- **Diverse Audience**: Targets students (future builders), buyers (consumers), and dealers (businesses)
- **Infrastructure Exists**: Leverages existing inspection data and systems
- **Modest Budget**: 20,000 ADA is conservative for deployment activities

## Concerns
- **Incomplete Proposal Data**: Timeline, detailed milestones, and participant targets not available
- **Adoption Metrics**: Success criteria unclear—how many mints? What adoption rate constitutes success?
- **Sustainability**: What happens after workshops end? How will ongoing minting be maintained?
- **Technical Barriers**: Will participants mint data themselves or is it done for them? UX friction unclear
- **Market Demand**: Is there demonstrated demand from car buyers/dealers for on-chain certificates?
- **Regulatory**: No mention of legal/regulatory considerations for automotive certification in Indonesia
- **Budget Breakdown**: No line-item costs for workshops, travel, materials, facilitator fees

## Recommendation
**FUND** - This proposal represents a strong, low-risk deployment of proven technology into a real market. The team has demonstrated capability, existing infrastructure, and a clear path to user activation. While detail is limited in extracted data, the Fund13 track record and practical RWA focus justify funding. Recommend requiring clear adoption metrics and sustainability plan in milestone reporting.

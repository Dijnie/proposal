| Impact | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5) | GOOD |
| Feasibility | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5) | GOOD |
| Value for Money | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5) | GOOD |
| **Average** | **4.0/5** | **GOOD** |

## Impact Review (4/5 Stars)
**Rating**: GOOD

**Strengths:**
- Addresses lack of structured, in-depth Governance Action reviews
- 300 research outputs over 12 months is substantial commitment
- Bilingual output (English + Portuguese) serves underrepresented community
- Helps counterbalance voting power concentration
- Creates public rationale repository for transparency

**Weaknesses:**
- Relies on continued governance activity to justify outputs
- Impact measurement (top 100 dReps by wallets) is indirect
- May overlap with other governance research initiatives

## Feasibility Review (4/5 Stars)
**Rating**: GOOD

**Strengths:**
- Proposer (Rodrigo Pacini) has 40+ on-chain votes with published rationales
- Led Manifesto Cardano Brasil initiative successfully
- Milestone Reviewer experience validates milestone-based approach
- Clear research framework methodology
- Eduardo Silka adds academic governance research expertise

**Weaknesses:**
- 300 outputs (100 per batch) is ambitious for small team
- Off-chain vote coverage scope is broad
- 12-month commitment requires sustained effort

## Value for Money Review (4/5 Stars)
**Rating**: GOOD

**Strengths:**
- Detailed cost breakdown with international benchmarking
- AI-assisted translation reduces costs (~50% savings)
- ₳39,250 for research/SME consultancy is core spend
- 10% contingency is reasonable
- Cost per output (~₳200) is efficient

**Weaknesses:**
- Budget of ₳59,834 is near maximum for category
- SME consultations at ₳80/hr adds up (₳2,250)
- Translation costs significant (₳5,000)

## Overall Assessment

This proposal from Agora Research Bureau addresses a genuine governance infrastructure gap. The commitment to produce 300 research outputs covering Governance Actions, Budget Proposals, and off-chain votes is ambitious but achievable given the team's track record.

Rodrigo Pacini's extensive Catalyst experience (Fund 2 veteran, 40+ on-chain votes as dRep, successful Fund 10 delivery) provides high confidence in execution. The bilingual approach (EN/PT-BR) strategically serves the underrepresented Portuguese-speaking community.

The detailed budget breakdown with AI-assisted efficiency and international rate benchmarking demonstrates fiscal responsibility. The main challenge is maintaining quality across 300 outputs while adapting to governance dynamics. This complements the team's other proposal (#1652) focused on Catalyst dRep analysis, creating a comprehensive governance research infrastructure.

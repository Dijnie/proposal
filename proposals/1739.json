Transactions on Cardano Layer 1 require 5–20 seconds to confirm, with higher network fees and limited throughput, making opening and closing positions slow, costly, and unsuitable for HFT strategies, scalping, or bot trading.\n\nHydra One is a Perpetuals derivatives trading platform designed to fundamentally overcome the core limitations of Cardano Layer 1: high latency, high transaction costs, and low throughput. Our solution combines the power of smart contracts with the ultra-fast execution of Hydra Layer 2 to deliver an experience comparable to centralized exchanges—while preserving Cardano’s security, transparency, and decentralization.\n\nWe move all high-speed operations—order matching, margin updates, PnL and funding rate calculations—into a Hydra Head, where transactions finalize almost instantly (sub-second) with zero block fees. Layer 1 is used solely to record essential state transitions (Commit / Decommit), ensuring immutability, auditability, and absolute asset security for users.\n\n**Hydra One is built on four core components:**\n\n1. Smart Contract: Manages assets, positions, liquidation logic, and ensures consistency and transparency.\n2. Hydra Head Execution: Enables high-speed execution, real-time computation, and supports HFT and bot trading.\n3. Liquidity Pool Engine: Transparent liquidity provisioning, fee distribution based on volume, and automated risk management.\n4. Backend &amp; API Layer: Connects the system to the UI, provides analytics data, and offers public APIs for partners and trading systems.\n\n**Below are the key documents we have carefully researched, designed, and validated for Hydra feasibility:**\n\n1. Business Requirement Document (BRD)\n2. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)\n3. System Flow Document (SFD)\n4. Technical Overview\n5. UI Screenshots &amp; Feature Showcase\n6.

The solution establishes next-generation DeFi infrastructure for Cardano—driving TVL, liquidity, trading activity, and enabling more dApps to build on Hydra.\n\nWe will demonstrate impact through an MVP running on a public Hydra Head, allowing the community to open/close positions in a real Hydra environment, benchmark performance, and verify feasibility. Hydra One sets a new standard for high-speed trading on Cardano and serves as a significant technical milestone for the ecosystem’s Layer 2 development trajectory.\n\n**User interface**\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vtechcom/hydra-one-docs/refs/heads/main/images/hydra-one-Home-v1.png)\n\n\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vtechcom/hydra-one-docs/refs/heads/main/images/hydra-one-LQ-v2.png)\n\n\n\n**High‑Level Architecture Diagram**\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vtechcom/hydra-one-docs/refs/heads/main/images/hydra-one-High%E2%80%91Level-Architecture.png)","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"Hydra One will create significant positive impact for the Cardano ecosystem by delivering the first high-speed Perpetuals trading platform running natively on Hydra Layer 2.\n\nIt demonstrates Cardano’s competitiveness in the DeFi market against fast ecosystems such as Solana and Arbitrum, and especially against specialized ultra-fast Layer 2 trading platforms like Hyperliquid, Aster, Lighter....\n\nThe project also showcases Cardano’s scalability through sub-second execution, near-zero fees, and a CEX-like trading experience that remains fully decentralized. This not only addresses the limitations of Layer 1 but also opens a completely new application layer for the community.\n\nWith Hydra One, traders can execute transactions in a DeFi environment as fast as centralized exchanges while retaining on-chain security. Liquidity providers gain access to transparent liquidity provisioning with fee rewards from higher trading volume, improving capital efficiency within the ecosystem. Development teams can learn from and reuse Hydra One's architecture to build their own Layer 2 applications, accelerating Hydra adoption across Cardano.\n\n**Impact will be measured through on\\-chain and Hydra\\-specific metrics such as:**\n\n- Total transactions executed in Hydra Heads,\n- Number of wallets interacting with the MVP,\n- Number of positions opened/closed,\n- Size and stability of experimental liquidity pools,\n- Commit / Decommit success rate,\n- and community participation during testing.\n\nOff-chain indicators such as demo traffic, number of developers integrating the API, and technical feedback will further validate the project’s effectiveness.\n\nAll results, technical documentation, smart contract source code, and the MVP demo will be made publicly available through GitHub, the project website, and Cardano community channels.

We felt the same—two years ago, we were extremely curious about Hydra and were drawn to its remarkable potential for building next-generation applications.\n\nHowever, Hydra still requires significant advancement in technical components, infrastructure, and developer tooling before it can be adopted at scale. Over more than a year of research, direct collaboration, and continuous support from our amazing friends at IOG and the wider community, we began developing a suite of tools and infrastructure solutions for the Hydra ecosystem, including:\n\n- Hydra SDK (a development toolkit for building dApps on Hydra), available at: [https://hydrasdk\\.com/](https://hydrasdk.com/)\n- Hydra Playground (a transaction builder to support app development), available at: [https://play\\.hydrasdk\\.com/](https://play.hydrasdk.com/)\n- Hydra HTLC demo (a solution for transferring assets across Hydra Heads), completed and open-sourced at: [https://github\\.com/Vtechcom/hydra\\-htlc\\-demo](https://github.com/Vtechcom/hydra-htlc-demo)\n- Hydra Wallet, Hydra Explorer, and several experimental game applications available at: [https://hydrawallet\\.app/](https://hydrawallet.app/)\n- And especially Hydra Hexcore and the Hydra Hub Infrastructure Solution, which provide automated deployment of Hydra Nodes / Hydra Heads and offer the most cost-efficient Hydra Head hosting for developers. These are being finalized and prepared for production launch at: [https://hydrahub\\.io\\.vn/](https://hydrahub.io.vn/)\n\nThese tools and products have already begun to be used by the community and various development teams. Our team has directly supported participants at the Cardano Hackathon Vietnam 2025 and will continue supporting teams at the upcoming Cardano Hackathon Asia 2025 – IBW Edition in India: [https://indiablockchainweek\\.com/](https://indiablockchainweek.com/)\n\nAt this event, we provide a fully configured Hydra Head environment, guide teams to integrate Hydra SDK, support off-chain/on-chain transaction handling, and help them build complete dApps within a short timeframe.\n\nThis capability demonstrates our team’s deep understanding of Hydra architecture, L1–L2 state synchronization, and optimal smart contract design for Layer 2.\n\nIn addition, we continue to invest time in exploring, debugging, proposing new functional ideas, and actively contributing code to improve and refine the Hydra protocol alongside the IOG Hydra Core Team: [https://github\\.com/cardano\\-scaling/hydra/issues?q=author%3Aaniadev](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues?q=author%3Aaniadev)\n\nFurthermore, the feasibility of Hydra One is strengthened by the technical foundation already in place:\n\n- Automated Hydra infrastructure system (Hydra Node Orchestrator — Hydra Hub)\n- Hydra SDK (TypeScript)\n- Hydra Head monitoring &amp; debugging tools — Hydra Explorer\n- Full project documentation including BRD, SRS, SFD, Technical Overview, UI/UX, and Use Cases, all carefully prepared [https://github\\.com/Vtechcom/hydra\\-one\\-docs/blob/main/README\\.md](https://github.com/Vtechcom/hydra-one-docs/blob/main/README.md)\n\nThese components serve as concrete evidence of our capability to execute this project.\n\nDuring the MVP phase, we will deploy a public Hydra Head testnet, perform sub-second latency benchmarks, run simulated transaction loads, and execute Commit / Decommit operations to Layer 1 to validate the reliability of our design. All progress, technical documentation, source code, and experimental results will be transparently published on GitHub, GitBook, and Cardano community channels.\n\nBy combining real-world Hydra experience, a fully developed infrastructure, and a clear project management framework, we are confident that Hydra One is fully feasible — and that our team is the right one to deliver this project at a production-ready scale for the Cardano ecosystem.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Milestones","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Project Milestones","description":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":null,"title":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","description":"The number of milestones required depends on the amount of funding requested.

We are submitting under the \"Prototyping new substantial features to existing on-chain products\" area of interest.\n\n\n\n**1. Ecosystem Research: The \"Implementation Gap\"**\n\n\n\nWe have analyzed existing solutions within the Cardano ecosystem (including previous Catalyst-funded projects like IAMX and standard Identus implementations):\n\n\n\n- **Existing Identity Wallets (e.g., RootsWallet, Lace):** These store credentials but do not provide a universal standard for *private* on-chain verification inside a third-party Smart Contract.\n\n- **DeFi KYC Solutions:** Most currently rely on centralized \"Allow Lists\" (registering wallet addresses on-chain).\n\n    - *The Problem:* This creates a public link between a user's wallet history and their real-world identity (GDPR nightmare), and often requires users to re-submit documents for every new dApp (high friction).\n\n- **Oracles (e.g., Charli3, Orcfax):** These focus on price feeds and data, not Identity Attributes.\n\n\n\n**2. The Socious Value Proposition**\n\n\n\nWe differ from existing market solutions by introducing **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Middleware** utilizing **Aiken**. We are not building a \"Walled Garden\" identity app; we are building the API that allows *other* dApps (DEXs, Voting Tools) to consume identity safely.\n\n\n\n### **Innovation A: Unlinking Identity from Activity (Privacy)**\n\n\n\n- **Current Solution:** A RealFi dApp whitelists user wallets. If the whitelist is leaked or inspected, the user is doxed.\n\n- **Socious ZK Innovation:** We decouple the attribute from the identifier. The user proves they possess a \"Compliant\" credential via a mathematical Zero-Knowledge Proof submitted to our Oracle.\n\n- **The Outcome:** The dApp receives a TRUE signal (User is Compliant), but **never sees the user’s name, country, or wallet history.** This is the breakthrough required for Institutional RealFi (RWA).\n\n\n\n### **Innovation B: Sybil Resistance without Biometrics**\n\n\n\n- **Current Solution:** \"Proof of Humanity\" models often require video submissions on IPFS, creating privacy concerns.\n\n- **Socious ZK Innovation:** We use the Liveness_Check credential stored in the user's self-sovereign DID (Hyperledger Identus). Our Oracle verifies uniqueness via a cryptographic \"Nullifier.\"\n\n- **The Outcome:** We enable **Quadratic Voting (1 Person = 1 Vote)** without ever asking users to publish biometric data publicly.\n\n\n\n### **Innovation C: Developer Experience (The \"One-Line\" Integration)**\n\n\n\n- **Current Solution:** Integrating Identity into a dApp currently requires deep knowledge of CIPs (Cardano Improvement Proposals) and complex off-chain code.\n\n- **Socious ZK Innovation:** We package the ZK verification into a simple SDK and an Aiken Smart Contract. A dApp developer can add Socious.verify({ requirement: 'human' }) to their workflow without being a cryptography expert.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"### **Prototype Overview: Deliverables & Access**\n\n\n\n### **Prototype Goal: Functional Testnet Launch**\n\n\n\nIn alignment with the category goal to \"achieve a public launch... for testing and feedback,\" our MVP will demonstrate a fully functional **Zero-Knowledge Identity Oracle** running on the Cardano Pre-Production Testnet.\n\n\n\nWe have moved past the concept phase. As an existing Cardano builder (Socious Platform is live), we possess the foundational code for Credential Issuance. This project scopes the **Verification Middleware**.\n\n\n\n### **What the Prototype Will Demonstrate**\n\n\n\nWe will demonstrate three tangible components that prove the \"End-to-End\" flow of private verification.\n\n\n\n### **1. The On-Chain Component: Aiken Oracle Contract**\n\n\n\n- **Demonstration:** A deployed smart contract that accepts ZK Proofs and returns validation data.\n\n- **Key Feature:** High-efficiency validation logic written in Aiken to ensure the cost of verifying a user is negligible (low ADA fees).\n\n- **Verification:** Users can inspect the script on Cardanoscan to confirm it executes logic trustlessly without centralized admins keys.\n\n\n\n### **2. The User Component: The \"ZK-Voting\" Demo dApp**\n\n\n\nTo gather user feedback, we will deploy a live Reference Implementation (e.g., \"The Socious Mock DAO\").\n\n\n\n- **Scenario:** A \"Sybil Defense\" test.\n\n- **User Action:** A user will claim a \"Verified Human\" credential from the Socious playground. They will attempt to vote on a proposal.\n\n- **The Proof:**\n\n    - **Success:** The vote counts, but the user's wallet address is NOT linked to their ID in the public metadata (Anonymous Voting).\n\n    - **Fail:** The user switches to a second wallet and tries to vote again. The Oracle rejects the transaction (Sybil Defense) despite the wallet being different, proving the \"Nullifier\" logic works.\n\n\n\n### **3. The Builder Component: Developer SDK & CLI**\n\n\n\n- **Demonstration:** A publicly available NPM package @socious/zk-oracle-sdk.\n\n- **Utility:** Enables any developer to generate the necessary ZKP on the client side and submit it to the chain.\n\n\n\n### Community Engagement & Feedback Plan\n\n\n\nOur engagement strategy prioritizes **Developer Experience (DX)** and **Security Validation**. We will move beyond passive updates to active collaboration with the Cardano developer ecosystem.\n\n\n\n**1. Transparent & Open Development (Milestones 1–3)**\n\n\n\n- **Open Source First:** All development will occur in public GitHub repositories. We will invite the **Aiken Community** and **Intersect** technical working groups to review our Oracle logic as it is built.\n\n- **Regular Updates:** We will post progress logs on the Cardano Forum and Discord, soliciting feedback on architectural decisions (e.g., ZK circuit design) before they are finalized.\n\n- **Developer Office Hours:** During the SDK development phase, we will host monthly open technical sessions to discuss integration friction points with early adopters.\n\n\n\n2. The \"Sybil Challenge\" (Milestone 4)\n\n\n\nWe will gamify the testing process to ensure the protocol is battle-tested before Mainnet release.\n\n\n\n- **Gamified Stress Testing:** We will launch the \"Mock DAO\" on Testnet and invite the community to \"break\" the identity uniqueness check.\n\n- **Structured Triage:** We will utilize GitHub Issues with clear severity classifications to organize and address community findings publicly.\n\n\n\n**3. Knowledge Transfer & Adoption (Milestone 5)**\n\n\n\n- **Integration Workshops:** Post-launch, we will conduct virtual workshops demonstrating how to integrate the SDK into existing Governance tools and dApps.\n\n- **Strategic Alignment:** We will actively solicit feedback from the **Project Catalyst** and **Intersect** operations teams to ensure our ZK-ID solution aligns with future requirements for \"Voltaire\" voting and Quadratic Funding.\n\n\n\n**Where to Engage**\n\n\n\n- **Source Code & Issues:** GitHub (Open License)\n\n- **Live Demo UI:** `playground.socious.io`\n\n- **Documentation:** `docs.socious.io/zk-oracle`\n\n- **Discussion:** Dedicated channels on the Socious Discord.\n\n\n\n### **Justification of On-Chain Transaction Impact**\n\n\n\nEvery verification is a transaction.\n\n\n\n- **Direct Impact:** Every time a user proves their identity to a dApp, they interact with the Oracle contract (TX generated).\n\n- **Multiplier Impact:** By enabling compliance, we unlock **Real World Assets (RWA)** on Cardano. RWAs generate high-volume, high-value settlement transactions that currently cannot exist on Cardano due to compliance blockers.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe realistic measures of success, ideally with on-chain metrics.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"### **Realistic Measures of Success**\n\n\n\nOur success criteria define the transition from \"Proprietary Identity App\" to \"Public Infrastructure.\" With a budget of **200,000 ADA**, we commit to delivering a robust, stress-tested protocol ready for critical ecosystem use.\n\n\n\nWe measure success through four distinct lenses: **Technical Deliverables**, **On-Chain Functionality**, **Developer Engagement**, and **Ecosystem Validation**.\n\n\n\n### **1. Technical Deliverables (The \"Definition of Done\")**\n\n\n\nWe commit to delivering verifiable, open-source code assets. Success is achieved when these components are public and usable:\n\n\n\n- **Aiken Smart Contracts:** Completion and open-sourcing of the ZK-Oracle validation scripts, fully optimized for Mainnet fee parameters.\n\n- **Developer SDK:** Publication of the @socious/zk-oracle package on NPM (Node Package Manager), enabling dApp integrations in under 30 minutes.\n\n- **Zero-Knowledge Circuits:** Publication of the ZK-circuit logic used to verify Hyperledger Identus credentials without revealing PII.\n\n\n\n### **2. On-Chain Metrics (Quantitative Verification)**\n\n\n\nWe will demonstrate success through visible activity on the **Cardano Pre-Production Testnet**. We define success by the reliability of the protocol.\n\n\n\n- **Metric 1: Prototype Transaction Volume (Target: 1,000+ Interactions)**\n\n    - *Measurement:* Tracking the Script Address of the Socious ZK-Oracle on a block explorer (Cexplorer.io).\n\n    - *Target:* We aim to generate **1,000+ verification transactions** during the \"Mock DAO\" community testing phase. Each transaction represents a user generating a ZKP and the contract validating it.\n\n- **Metric 2: Sybil Defense Success Rate (Target: 100%)**\n\n    - *Measurement:* During the public \"Sybil Challenge,\" we will track rejected transactions.\n\n    - *Success Criterion:* The on-chain oracle must correctly reject **100%** of attempts where a verified user tries to vote twice using different wallets. This serves as the technical Proof-of-Concept for secure Quadratic Funding.\n\n- **Metric 3: Smart Contract Optimization (Cost verification)**\n\n    - *Measurement:* Benchmarking **ExUnits (Memory & CPU)** usage.\n\n    - *Target:* Ensuring verification costs remain minimal (approaching standard tx fees) to ensure this infrastructure is scalable for DAOs with thousands of members.\n\n\n\n### **3. User Adoption & Feedback (The Feedback Loop)**\n\n\n\nSince this is a prototype, \"User\" is defined as **Developers** and **Early Testers**.\n\n\n\n- **Developer Engagement:**\n\n    - *Metric:* 5+ unique forks/stars on the GitHub repository within 3 months of launch.\n\n    - *Metric:* 50+ unique downloads of the SDK via NPM, validating the \"Developer Experience\" (DX).\n\n- **The \"Mock DAO\" Participation:**\n\n    - *Metric:* 100+ Unique DIDs claiming credentials to participate in our demo environment.\n\n    - *Rationale:* This proves that the User Experience (UX) of verifying—which requires interacting with a ZK-Prover—is seamless enough for average Cardano voters.\n\n\n\n### **4. Qualitative Ecosystem Validation (Governance)**\n\n\n\nWe aim to position Socious as the enabling technology for fair governance at scale.\n\n\n\n- **Catalyst Future Pathway:** We aim to demonstrate that ZK-ID is the viable technical solution to implement secure **Quadratic Funding** in future Catalyst rounds, solving the current \"1 Coin = 1 Vote\" wealth bias without forcing DRep delegation.\n\n- **Intersect Scale:** Successfully demonstrating that the solution can automate \"Membership Checks\" for Intersect’s constitutional governance, scaling their **One-Person-One-Vote** model using cryptographic verification rather than manual checks.\n\n\n\n### **Justification of Metrics Strategy**\n\n\n\nThese measures reflect a **200,000 ADA** ambition. We are not just shipping \"code that runs\"; we are shipping \"code that is secured, audited, and optimized.\" By tracking cost-efficiency and 100% Sybil defense rates, we demonstrate that Cardano has a production-ready Identity Oracle capable of handling millions of dollars in RWA or governance power.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Your Project and Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","description":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","format":null,"answer":"**The Problem: The \"Privacy vs. Trust\" Paradox**\n\n\n\nCardano adoption is currently throttled by two fundamental conflicts that cannot be solved by standard smart contracts alone:\n\n\n\n1. **DeFi Compliance (RealFi):** To unlock Institutional Liquidity and Real World Assets (RWAs), protocols must enforce KYC/AML rules. Currently, this forces users to upload passports to centralized servers (high hacking risk) or whitelist public wallet addresses (doxxing their financial history). This destroys the privacy ethos of blockchain.\n\n2. **Governance Integrity (DAOs):** Cardano governance (Project Catalyst, DAOs) aims for fairness. However, standard \"1 Token = 1 Vote\" systems inevitably lead to Plutocracy (Whale dominance). Alternative models like Quadratic Voting fail because they cannot prevent Sybil Attacks (one person creating 100 wallets).\n\n\n\n**The Solution: The Socious ZK-Identity Oracle**\n\n\n\nWe are proposing the development of **Middleware Infrastructure**—an Aiken-based Zero-Knowledge Identity Oracle. This SDK allows *any* third-party dApp on Cardano to verify a user’s \"Humanity\" or \"Compliance\" status without ever seeing their underlying data.\n\n\n\nThis project is not a cold start; it is the strategic \"Verification Layer\" built on top of our **existing, live Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) platform.**\n\n\n\n### **1. Building on Proven Foundations (Foundational Work)**\n\n\n\nUnlike theoretical proposals, Socious is an established Cardano builder. The \"Issuer\" and \"Holder\" components of our architecture are **already operational**.\n\n\n\n- **Live Product:** app.socious.io is a live Web3 platform where users create accounts and receive Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).\n\n- **Open Source Commitment:** Our entire tech stack operates with an \"Open Source First\" philosophy. Reviewers can verify our technical capabilities and existing work at our public repository: [https://github\\.com/socious\\-io\\.](https://github.com/socious-io.)\n\n- **The Prototype Gap:** We currently issue credentials using **Hyperledger Identus** (formerly Atala PRISM). The missing piece—which this proposal funds—is the **On-Chain Verification Bridge** (The Oracle) that allows smart contracts to consume these credentials privately.\n\n\n\n### **2. Technical Architecture: How the Oracle Works**\n\n\n\nOur solution architecture separates **Identity** (User) from **Validation** (dApp) using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).\n\n\n\n**Layer 1: The Identity Wallet (Existing/Socious)**\n\n\n\n- The user completes verification (e.g., Liveness Check or KYC) via the Socious platform.\n\n- A verifiable credential (e.g., Credential_Humanity_V1) is issued to the user's DID.\n\n\n\n**Layer 2: The ZK-Prover (New Prototype Deliverable)**\n\n\n\n- We will build a client-side SDK that runs in the user's browser or wallet.\n\n- When a user interacts with a dApp, this SDK generates a **Zero-Knowledge Proof**.\n\n- *The Logic:* \"I attest that I own a valid credential signed by Socious, and I generate Nullifier_Hash_XYZ.\"\n\n- *The Innovation:* This proof does not contain the user's name, country, or wallet history—only the mathematical assurance of truth.\n\n\n\n**Layer 3: The Verification Smart Contract (New Prototype Deliverable - Aiken)**\n\n\n\n- We will deploy a highly optimized **Aiken Smart Contract** on the Cardano Pre-Production Testnet and Mainnet.\n\n- This contract acts as the **Oracle**. It accepts the ZK Proof, verifies the cryptography on-chain, and returns a Boolean (True/False) to the calling dApp.\n\n\n\n### **3. Addressing Key Use Cases**\n\n\n\n**Use Case A: Sybil-Resistant Voting (Solving the Bot Problem)**\n\n\n\nDAOs want \"One Person, One Vote\" but don't want to force members to dox themselves.\n\n\n\n- **The Workflow:**\n\n    1. User connects wallet to DAO voting dApp.\n\n    2. User calls Socious.Vote({ Proposal_ID }).\n\n    3. Our system generates a \"Nullifier\" (a unique hash specific to *this* user + *this* vote).\n\n- **The Sybil Defense:** If the user switches to a second wallet and tries to vote again, they will technically generate the **same** Nullifier (because it is derived from their unique biological identity/credential). The Oracle sees the duplicate Nullifier and rejects the second vote.\n\n- **Result:** Mathematical guarantee of uniqueness without biometric exposure.\n\n\n\n**Use Case B: DeFi Compliance (Solving the Regulatory Problem)**\n\n\n\nRealFi protocols (e.g., Tokenized Bonds, Real Estate) need to block users from sanctioned jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n- **The Workflow:**\n\n    1. User connects wallet to a Compliance-Gated DEX.\n\n    2. User generates a ZK proof: *\"My country is NOT in the list [NK, IR, RU, ...]\"*.\n\n    3. The Oracle verifies the proof valid.\n\n    4. The DEX Smart Contract allows the deposit.\n\n- **Result:** Regulatory compliance is satisfied, but the user's personal identity is never stored by the DEX or revealed on-chain.\n\n\n\n### **4. Deliverables & Integration Plan**\n\n\n\nOur goal is to launch a functional **Reference Implementation** that developers can test.\n\n\n\n**Deliverable 1: The @socious/zk-oracle SDK**\n\n\n\n- An NPM package allowing any developer to integrate \"Log in with ZK-Identity\" in minutes.\n\n- Example code: const verify = await Socious.verify({ requirements: ['KYC_Level_1'] });\n\n\n\n**Deliverable 2: The \"Mock DAO\" Demo App**\n\n\n\n- A publicly accessible URL where Catalyst users can claim a \"Test Credential\" and try to \"break\" the voting system using bots. This gamifies the testing process.\n\n\n\n**Deliverable 3: Open Source Aiken Contracts**\n\n\n\n- Fully commented, audited, and optimized Aiken scripts available on GitHub for community reuse.\n\n\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n\n\nThis proposal upgrades the Cardano ecosystem from \"Basic Identity\" (storing data) to **\"Actionable Identity\"** (using data privately). By combining our existing open-source platform with a new Aiken verification layer, we provide the essential infrastructure required for **Quadratic Voting**, **Privacy-Preserving DeFi**, and **Regulatory Compliance**.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"### **[IMPACT] Positive Impact on the Wider Cardano Community**\n\n\n\nOur proposal transforms Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) from a theoretical standard into a **commercial utility**. By building the **Socious ZK-Identity Oracle**, we deliver the critical middleware that bridges the gap between user privacy and ecosystem needs (Compliance & Fairness).\n\n\n\nWe define our impact through three specific vectors: **Unlocking RealFi Liquidity**, **Solving Governance Fairness**, and **Open-Source Developer Acceleration**.\n\n\n\n### **1. Driving Meaningful On-Chain Transaction Volume**\n\n\n\nIn alignment with the category requirements, this project is designed to drive verifiable increases in network activity. Unlike standalone dApps limited by their own marketing, our product is **Middleware**. This means our transaction volume scales with the success of *every* dApp that integrates us.\n\n\n\n- **The \"Verification\" Transaction:** Every time a user interacts with a gated DeFi pool, a Launchpad, or a DAO vote using our SDK, they must submit a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to our on-chain Oracle.\n\n- **The Multiplier Effect:**\n\n    - If a Lending Protocol integrates Socious ZK-Oracle to comply with regulations, **every loan origination** generates an additional verification transaction on the Cardano network.\n\n    - If a Voting Tool integrates us for Sybil Defense, **every vote cast** requires an accompanying Oracle verification call.\n\n- **Economic Impact:** These are complex script interactions (Aiken Smart Contracts) that utilize block space and generate fees for Stake Pool Operators (SPOs), contributing directly to network sustainability.\n\n\n\n### **2. Unlocking Institutional Liquidity (The RealFi Impact)**\n\n\n\nCardano has technically superior DeFi primitives, yet it lags in **Total Value Locked (TVL)** from institutional sources compared to chains with mature compliance layers. Institutions cannot touch \"Wild West\" DeFi due to AML/sanctions risks.\n\n\n\n- **The Compliance Paradox:** Current solutions force institutions to choose between using Cardano (and facing regulatory risk) or building private permissioned chains (fragmenting liquidity).\n\n- **Our Solution Impact:** The Socious ZK-Oracle allows public Cardano dApps (DEXs, Lending Pools) to enforce regulatory rules (e.g., \"Block Sanctioned Jurisdictions\") **without collecting user data**.\n\n- **Ecosystem Result:** This \"Privacy-Preserving Compliance\" removes the barrier to entry for **Real World Assets (RWAs)**. It allows tokenized real estate, bonds, and corporate credit to flourish on Cardano Mainnet, bringing massive liquidity and utility to the chain.\n\n\n\n### **3. Solving the \"Plutocracy vs. Sybil\" Governance Dilemma**\n\n\n\nGovernance is the central pillar of Cardano (Voltaire Era). However, current voting mechanisms face a critical failure mode:\n\n\n\n- **1 Token = 1 Vote:** Leads to Plutocracy (Whale dominance).\n\n- **Quadratic Voting (1 Person = 1 Vote):** Leads to Sybil Attacks (one person spinning up 100 wallets to game the system).\n\n\n\n**Our Solution Impact:** By providing an API for **Anonymous Uniqueness**, we enable safe Quadratic Voting for the entire ecosystem (Project Catalyst, Intersect, independent DAOs).\n\n\n\n- **Sybil Defense:** We allow DAOs to mathematically ensure 1 Person = 1 Vote using our \"Nullifier\" logic.\n\n- **Anti-Coercion:** Because we use Zero-Knowledge proofs, voting remains private. This prevents vote-buying and coercion, protecting the integrity of Cardano’s decentralized governance.\n\n\n\n### **4. Accelerating Developer Innovation (Open Source Impact)**\n\n\n\nThis category focuses on \"builders.\" We significantly reduce the barriers for new developers entering the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n- **Reducing Time-to-Market:** Currently, a developer wanting to add Sybil resistance to their dApp must spend weeks learning cryptography, ZK-Snarks, and Identus standards. With the **Socious SDK**, they can implement Socious.Verify({ uniqueness: true }) in lines of code.\n\n- **Public Goods:** We are committed to **Open Source**. All Aiken smart contracts and ZK circuit definitions produced in this pilot will be published under permissible licenses. This allows other identity providers to adopt our standards, fostering interoperability rather than vendor lock-in.\n\n\n\n### **5. Enhancing Privacy as a Default**\n\n\n\nPrivacy is a core value of the Cardano community (e.g., Midnight). However, privacy tools are often hard to use.\n\n\n\n- **Normalized Privacy:** By embedding ZK verification into standard dApp flows (logging in, voting, trading), we normalize privacy-preserving behaviors. Users get utilized to proving *attributes* (\"I am over 18\") rather than revealing *data* (\"Here is my date of birth\").\n\n- **Data Minimization:** We help dApp builders reduce their legal liability. By using our Oracle, a DeFi builder never has to touch user data (Passports/PII), saving them from GDPR/Data Protection liabilities.\n\n\n\n### **Measure of Success for the Wider Community**\n\n\n\nWe will consider this project a success for the community if we can demonstrate:\n\n\n\n1. **Interoperability:** A user claiming a credential on Socious can use it to vote on a *separate*, third-party DAO interface (our \"Reference Implementation\").\n\n2. **Cost Efficiency:** The gas fees for on-chain ZK verification are low enough that they do not price out users from participation.\n\n3. **Adoption:** At least 2 external developer teams express interest in integrating the SDK during the feedback phase.\n\n\n\nBy funding this prototype, the community gains a **foundational infrastructure primitive**—a tool that allows every other builder on Cardano to create applications that are compliant, fair, and private by default.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

Each transaction conducted is meticulously documented with tangible evidence and audited internally for accuracy. To bolster our commitment to financial transparency, we have established collaborations with external accounting firms that assure compliance.\n\nThis meticulous, multilayered approach to fund management reflects our dedication to maintaining high levels of trust and accountability.\n\n\n\nThe feasibility of the proposed approach will be validated through a multi-pronged strategy that leverages our existing live platform and focuses on creating and testing key deliverables:\n\n\n\n1. **Building on Proven Foundations (Existing Product Validation):**\n\n    - The **\"Issuer\" and \"Holder\" components** of the architecture (users creating accounts and receiving Decentralized Identifiers/DIDs) are **already operational** on our live Web3 platform, `app.socious.io`. This eliminates the feasibility risk for the identity issuance side of the project.\n\n    - Our commitment to **Open Source** allows community and technical reviewers to **verify our existing work** and technical capabilities at our public repository: `[https://github\\.com/socious\\-io\\`\\.](https://github.com/socious-io`.)\n\n2. **Delivering and Testing the Core Technical Components (Prototype Validation):**\n\n    - **Deliverable 1: The `@socious/zk-oracle` SDK (Client-Side Feasibility).** The feasibility of the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) generation will be validated by successfully building this client-side SDK package and demonstrating its ability to generate a valid ZK Proof in the user's browser/wallet using an existing verifiable credential.\n\n    - **Deliverable 2: Open Source Aiken Contracts (On-Chain Feasibility).** Feasibility will be proven by successfully deploying the highly optimized **Aiken Smart Contract** (the Oracle) to the Cardano Pre-Production Testnet and Mainnet. The contract must demonstrably verify the cryptography of the ZK Proof and return the required boolean (`True`/`False`) outcome to a calling dApp.\n\n3. **Real-World Demonstration and Stress Testing (Use Case Validation):**\n\n    - **Deliverable 3: The \"Mock DAO\" Demo App.** This is the ultimate proof of feasibility for the Sybil-Resistance use case. We will:\n\n        - Create a publicly accessible URL where users can test the system.\n\n        - Gamify the testing process by encouraging users to actively try to \"break\" the voting system using multiple wallets/bots.\n\n        - The system is proven feasible if the Oracle successfully **rejects duplicate votes** by identifying the same `Nullifier_Hash` (derived from a single identity/credential), thereby providing a **mathematical guarantee of uniqueness** without exposing personal data.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Milestones","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Project Milestones","description":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":null,"title":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","description":"The number of milestones required depends on the amount of funding requested.

This represents exceptional value for money because we are not merely building a standalone application; we are building **foundational infrastructure** that unlocks privacy-preserving governance (Quadratic Funding) for the entire ecosystem.\n\n\n\n1. High-ROI Infrastructure Investment (The Multiplier Effect)\n\n\n\nThe primary value of this proposal lies in its open-source SDK approach. By packaging complex ZK circuits and Aiken validation logic into an easy-to-use NPM library (@socious/zk-oracle), we dramatically lower the barrier to entry for future developers.\n\n\n\n- **Cost Savings for the Ecosystem:** Instead of every DAO building their own identity layer (costing ~200k ADA each time), they can integrate our verified solution in minutes.\n\n- **Enabling \"Voltaire\" Goals:** We provide the technical rails necessary for Intersect and Catalyst to implement true \"One-Person-One-Vote\" and Quadratic Funding without sacrificing user privacy or decentralization.\n\n\n\n2. Cost-Efficient Technical Specialization\n\n\n\nZero-Knowledge (ZK) circuit engineering and Aiken smart contract optimization are highly specialized skills that command premium market rates.\n\n\n\n- **Allocating 47% (94,000 ADA)** of the budget directly to Backend and Blockchain engineering ensures the core technology is robust.\n\n- **Optimization Focused:** We have dedicated budget lines for script optimization (Milestone 2) to ensure that while development costs are fixed, the *operating costs* (transaction fees) for future users remain minimal. We are absorbing the R&D cost so the community doesn't pay high execution fees later.\n\n\n\n3. Professional Risk Management\n\n\n\nWe have structured the budget to ensure delivery reliability, protecting the community's investment:\n\n\n\n- **Distributed Contingency:** Rather than a vague \"slush fund,\" our **10% contingency (20,000 ADA)** is allocated across specific milestones to handle known risks (e.g., circuit complexity in M1, browser compatibility in M3).\n\n- **Real-World Stress Testing:** We have allocated resources specifically for managing a public \"Sybil Challenge\" (Milestone 4). This budget covers the **engineering and operational hours** required to coordinate the public testing phase, triage incoming bug reports in real-time, and patch vulnerabilities before mainnet launch.\n\n\n\n4. Transparent Budget Breakdown\n\n\n\nOur 200,000 ADA budget is allocated to maximize technical output while maintaining operational rigor:\n\n\n\n- **Blockchain & Backend (47% - 94,000 ADA):** ZK Circuit design, Aiken contract dev, and SDK architecture.\n\n- **Frontend & UI/UX (20% - 40,000 ADA):** \"Mock DAO\" voting interface and wallet integration.\n\n- **Project Management & Ops (13% - 26,000 ADA):** Sprint planning, reporting, and GitHub repository management.\n\n- **Testing, QA & Security (7.5% - 15,000 ADA):** Unit testing, internal audits, and **coordinating the public Sybil Challenge.**\n\n- **Infrastructure (2.5% - 5,000 ADA):** Server costs and hosting.\n\n- **Contingency (10% - 20,000 ADA):** Buffers for volatility and unexpected technical hurdles.\n\n\n\nBy delivering a documented, stress-tested, and open-source ZK protocol, Socious ensures that every ADA spent translates into lasting utility for the Cardano governance ecosystem.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only;

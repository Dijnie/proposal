Each interaction includes wallet creation, testnet transactions, and minting inspection-report NFTs, allowing participants to experience Cardano through a practical, familiar real-world asset: a used car.\n\nThis approach matters because Cardano adoption in Southeast Asia is limited not by technology, but by the absence of relatable entry points for non-crypto users. The automotive sector (where 20+ million vehicles change hands annually in Indonesia) suffers from persistent trust failures (fraud, hidden damage, unverifiable claims). Showing how Cardano can anchor inspection data, metadata, and ownership context creates an immediate and intuitive value proposition.\n\nBy activating universities, workshops, garages, and dealer networks, this program builds a scalable pipeline of new users, new developers, and industry partners who interact with Cardano for the first time through a concrete RWA use case. It expands Cardano’s visibility beyond crypto communities, generates measurable on-chain activity, and provides a reproducible model for real-world ecosystem growth in emerging markets.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Provide a list of key activities of your project:","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"**1\\.

The program focuses on hands-on adoption through workshops, roadshows, and pilot deployments that demonstrate Cardano’s value in everyday automotive transactions.\n\n\n\n**1\\. University Technical Workshops**\n\nWe collaborate with engineering and technology faculties to run structured, example-driven sessions on Cardano fundamentals, RWA concepts, metadata, and NFT-based inspection certificates. Students create wallets, mint testnet inspection NFTs, and experiment with real automotive datasets contributed by PALAPA. This creates the first academic pipeline for Cardano RWA applications in Indonesia.\n\n\n\n**2\\. Automotive Community Roadshows**\n\nWe conduct in-person activation events with car clubs, garages, indie mechanics, and used-car buyers. Each roadshow includes a live vehicle inspection, real-time minting of an NFT inspection report on testnet, wallet onboarding, and simplified educational materials in Indonesian. This enables first-time users to experience Cardano directly in a familiar real-world setting.\n\n\n\n**3\\. Dealer Pilot Deployment**\n\nSelected used-car dealers will participate in a structured pilot program. PALAPA performs real inspections, converts each result into a testnet NFT report, and gathers feedback from sellers and consumers. This creates measurable, verifiable evidence of Cardano’s usefulness for transparency and fraud reduction in the automotive market.\n\n\n\n**3\\. Open\\-Access Field Deployment Playbook**\n\nTo ensure replicability within and beyond Indonesia, we publish a complete playbook covering event structures, workshop templates, messaging guides, metadata standards, onboarding scripts, and recommended deployment steps for other Cardano builders. This mirrors the open-knowledge model of Fund14 education proposals.\n\n\n\n**4\\. Final Public Report & Showcase**\n\nWe conclude the program with a full, publicly accessible report containing KPIs, on-chain statistics, attendance data, dealer insights, videos, and recommendations for Fund16 scale-up.

By operating directly in Indonesia’s automotive sector that has a high-volume market where trust, verification, and documentation are persistent issues, the initiative demonstrates how Cardano can deliver practical, accessible value for everyday users. Rather than focusing solely on developer or technical audiences, the program brings blockchain concepts into environments where they can be immediately understood through real assets, real inspections, and real user interactions.\n\nThrough university workshops and community roadshows, participants gain hands-on experience with wallets, metadata, and testnet NFT minting using actual automotive inspection data. This creates a meaningful onboarding pathway that connects Cardano to concrete use cases rather than abstract theory. The dealer pilot extends this impact further by producing real inspection-backed NFTs and gathering field insights that feed directly into future RWA ecosystem development.\n\nAll materials, templates, metadata structures, and the Field Deployment Playbook are openly accessible, enabling reuse and replication across Southeast Asia and other industries. This ensures that the initiative continues to benefit the ecosystem beyond its direct execution and provides a reference model for future Catalyst proposers working on RWA or industry adoption.\n\n**Key areas of positive impact include:**\n\n**1\\. Adoption in a mainstream sector**\n\nCardano gains visibility in a high-frequency consumer market, reinforcing its relevance for industries with real trust problems.\n\n**2\\. Practical onboarding at scale**\n\nHundreds of first-time users are introduced to Cardano through hands-on experiences tied to real-world activities, not speculative use cases.\n\n**3\\. Demonstrable RWA utility**\n\nNFT inspection certificates become a simple, clear proof of how blockchain can support asset transparency and lifecycle documentation.\n\n**4\\. Replicable framework for the ecosystem**\n\nThe open-access Field Deployment Playbook allows other teams to reproduce workshops, roadshows, and pilot structures across regions and verticals.\n\n**5\\.

An intuitive interface where users decide in which categories to vote asd then see two proposals or nominees at a time, pick their favorite, and repeat until done. There are AI summaries to help learn more about the products. This makes ranking and decision-making simple, fast, and engaging for all participants.\n- Liquid Democracy. Voting power can be delegated by category to different trusted experts. Delegates can also delegate forward, creating dynamic flows of trust and surfacing the most respected thought leaders in each domain. Anyone in the delegation chain can decide to vote on a specific category reclaiming the voting power that they have delegated.\n\n# Pairwise Use Cases:\n- Ranking proposals for governance decisions.\n- Participatory budgeting.\n- Retroactive funding.\n- Selecting delegates and representatives.\n- Any other decision-making process that benefits from category-specific expertise and community-driven rankings.\n\nPairwise has been successfully used in 5 Optimism Retro Funding rounds, allocating $50M+ across 1,000+ projects. Its simple UX, Sybil resistance, and category-based liquid delegation make it a natural fit for Cardano governance experiments where the community is empowered to not only decide on the Cardano constitution, but also on grants and other key decision for the ecosystem development through Project Catalyst and Intersect.\n\nAny Cardano project, DAO, or organization, could reach out to Pairwise to set up a gamified vote for it’s specific use case.\n\n# Pilot Implementation: The Cardano Awards\nTo debut Pairwise on Cardano, we will host the Cardano Awards Ceremony, where ADA holders, DReps, and builders will decide what has been “the best of the best” on Cardano in 2025.\n\n# How it works:\n1. Define categories (e.g., Best dApp, Best new project, Most Innovative Use of Cardano, Best UX, etc.).\n2. Nominate projects via open community nominations or curated lists, for example, Project Catalyst projects.\n3. Custom voting power allocation to multiple stakeholders like ADA holders, voters, builders, etc.\n4. Voting or delegating by category. Delegation happens in one click, or even via a public tweet to spark viral buzz.\n5. Gamified UX. Projects are shown two at a time; users pick their favorite; repeat until done.\n\n# Why this matters for Cardano\n- Engages the full ecosystem, from token holders to builders, through participatory and fun decision-making.\n- Generates social buzz as projects and delegates campaign publicly on X (Twitter) they generate a viral flywheel of attention to Cardano projects.\n- Builds governance capacity with a tested, user-friendly tool that can be repurposed for budgeting, retrofunding, and representative selection.\n- Delivers granular insights on community preferences by category and stakeholder type.\n\nWe will bring battle-tested governance building blocks to the Cardano ecosystem, paired with a highly visible pilot to spotlight the Cardano community’s favorite projects","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"# Value to Cardano Community:\n\n\n1.

Cardano Integration with Attestation Service - 150,000 ADA\n    -  We will make Pairwise work seamlessly on Cardano. This includes:\n        - Connecting ADA wallets so anyone in the Cardano community can participate.\n        - Creating a Cardano UI kit and dedicated Cardano section in Pairwise for this MVP and future votes for the Cardano community. We would be excited to try an experiment with Project Catalyst.\n        - Votes attested on-chain pseudonymously Each vote = signed credential proving eligibility & voting power (no real identity or wallet address exposed).\n        - Zero-knowledge / selective disclosure proofs confirm voting rights while keeping voter details private.\n- Cardano Awards – Design, Operations & Marketing – 50,000 ADA\n    - A high-visibility, community-led event to celebrate Cardano’s best projects. Funding will cover:\n        - Designing a voting power model tailored for The Cardano Awards to include multiple stakeholders in the Cardano community.\n        - Event branding and visual design.\n        - Customizing Pairwise for the Awards voting experience.\n        - Coordinating with community stakeholders and nominees.\n        - Running social media campaigns to maximize awareness and participation.\n        - Handling project operations to ensure smooth delivery from integration to launch.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Value for Money","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"How does the cost of the project represent value for the Cardano ecosystem?","description":"How does the cost of the project represent value for the Cardano ecosystem?","format":null,"answer":"This proposal delivers not one, but two reusable governance building blocks: a best-in-class, mobile-ready voting UX and a flexible, category-based liquid democracy system. Both will be built to be reusable by other Cardano projects, DAO, or organizations.\n\n\n\nGovernance, and specifically liquid democracy, is a key area of interest for the Cardano community. By providing a tested, production-ready implementation, we enable real-world experimentation that will help refine governance models for initiatives like the Cardano Constitution, Project Catalyst, and Intersect’s decision-making processes. Different implementations and live use cases are essential to discover what works best for Cardano’s unique governance vision. All our development will be open source.\n\n\n\nPairwise’s proven track record, used in five Optimism Retro Funding rounds to allocate $50M+ across 1,000+ projects, shows our capacity to deliver. The Cardano integration created under this proposal will be a permanent infrastructure, usable long after the Cardano Awards. Subsequent experiments will not have an integration cost anymore, although there will be an operation cost, which will be much lower.\n\n\n\nThe Cardano Awards Ceremony serves as a high-visibility pilot, stress-testing the integration in a real event that will:\n\n- Engage ADA holders, stablecoin holders in Cardano, DReps, and builders with participatory, gamified decision-making.\n- Showcase Cardano’s vibrant ecosystem to a wider audience through viral social media mechanics.\n- Generate actionable insights on community preferences by category and stakeholder group.\n\n\n\nThis approach builds lasting tools while creating immediate engagement, delivering both short-term visibility and long-term governance capacity.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only; excludes retroactive funding, incentives, giveaways, re-granting, or sub-treasuries.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

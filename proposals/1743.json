This prevents Cardano dApps from accessing millions of Lightning users, receiving micropayments, and slows down Hydra/Cardano adoption due to the lack of real external liquidity.\n\nOur solution is to build a fully open-source Lightning &lt;-&gt; Hydra HTLC Bridge, enabling cross-L2 value transfers that are atomic, trustless, and near-instant. This approach directly solves the problem through HTLCs — a proven cryptographic primitive deployed on both Lightning and Hydra.\n\nThe project consists of the following key components:\n\n**1\\. HTLC Smart Contract running inside Hydra Head \\(Aiken\\)**\n\nWe will develop an Aiken validator that implements:\n\n- Hash-lock: funds can only be claimed by revealing the correct preimage.\n- Time-lock: funds automatically refund after expiry.\n- Atomicity: Hydra unlocks funds only if Lightning has already revealed the valid secret.\n\nThis forms the foundation for safe cross-L2 interoperability, and builds directly on the Hydra&lt;-&gt;Hydra HTLC demo we released and which was acknowledged by the Hydra Core Team.\n\n**2\\. Bridge Service \\(stateless coordination engine\\)**\n\nWe will build a stateless backend responsible for:\n\n- Creating Lightning and Hydra HTLCs using the same hash h.\n- Monitoring Lightning payment events.\n- Automatically retrieving preimage x upon LN payment.\n- Broadcasting the claim transaction on Hydra.\n- Managing timeout and refund logic end-to-end.\n\nA stateless architecture ensures the bridge never holds user funds, requires no liquidity providers, and avoids the centralization risks common in cross-chain bridges.\n\n**3\\. Lightning Regtest Environment**\n\nTo ensure anyone can reproduce the demo:\n\n- Initialize an LND regtest node via Docker.\n- Provide scripts to create invoices, perform payments, and simulate HTLC flows.\n- Allow developers to run the full atomic swap pipeline without external infrastructure.\n\n**4\\. Browser\\-based Demo Interface**\n\nThe UI will showcase:\n\n- The full HTLC lifecycle in real time: lock → claim → refund\n- Event logs from Lightning and Hydra\n- Transaction list, swap status, and error cases\n- Visual explanations suitable for workshops, hackathons, and education\n\nThis helps developers easily understand and adopt cross-L2 models.\n\n**5\\. Complete Documentation &amp; Guides**\n\nWe will publish:\n\n- Architecture diagrams\n- State machine specifications\n- dApp integration guides\n- Example code\n- A 2–3 minute demo video\n\nAll made public for transparency and extensibility.\n\n**Client Screenshot:**\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vtechcom/hydra-htlc-demo/refs/heads/master/docs/client.png)\n\n**Server Screenshot:**\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vtechcom/hydra-htlc-demo/refs/heads/master/docs/server-demo.png)\n\n\n\n**Why this approach is the best fit**\n\n- HTLCs are a long-established, reliable cryptographic mechanism used extensively on Bitcoin, Lightning, and other atomic swap bridges.\n- Hydra offers fast confirmation and snapshot events, ideal for atomic bridging.\n- Lightning is the world’s largest L2 payment network, so connecting it to Cardano creates immediate value.\n- The non-custodial design eliminates security and centralization risks.\n- Our team is among the very few who have already implemented HTLCs inside Hydra successfully.\n\n**Who benefits from this solution**\n\n- Cardano dApp developers needing real-time payments or micropayments\n- Lightning users wanting access to Cardano’s ecosystem\n- Researchers and educators teaching cross-L2 interoperability\n- Hydra operators gaining practical use cases\n- The broader Cardano community, which gains a pathway to the Bitcoin ecosystem\n\n**How we will prove solution effectiveness**\n\nWe commit to delivering all of the following:\n\n- Fully open-source MVP runnable via Docker\n- A live demo of Lightning &lt;-&gt; Hydra value transfer\n- 500+ successful test transactions\n- Zero lost funds across all timeout/refund scenarios\n- Latency benchmark under 2 seconds\n\n**Why we propose this after extensive ecosystem research**\n\nThrough analysis of Cardano’s needs and exploration of Bitcoin’s architecture, we identified strong benefits for Cardano:\n\nThis will be the first non-custodial bridge between Cardano and Lightning, creating real liquidity flow, real users, and enabling applications such as:\n\n- Payment streaming\n- On-chain gaming\n- IoT micropayments\n- Hydra multi-hop routing\n- Future cross-L2 DeFi models\n\nIt lays the foundation for long-term interoperability between Cardano and the Bitcoin ecosystem — a major step forward for Cardano L2.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"The project creates the first decentralized payment bridge between the Lightning Network and Hydra Head, enabling real-time interoperability between Bitcoin’s largest L2 and Cardano’s L2.

Unlocking liquidity flow from Lightning → Cardano\n\nLightning has millions of active users and is the most mature micropayment ecosystem.\n\nThe bridge enables:\n\n- Cardano dApps to receive real payments from Lightning users\n- Attraction of external liquidity into Cardano\n- Increased visibility of Cardano within the Bitcoin community\n\nThis creates a direct and measurable boost to ecosystem adoption.\n\nb. Delivering Cardano’s first cross-L2 payment route\n\nWith Hydra’s near-instant confirmations, the bridge unlocks new use cases:\n\n- Real-time gaming\n- IoT payments\n- Streaming &amp; micropayments\n- Real-time DeFi\n\nNo current project on Cardano provides these capabilities.\n\nc. Strong educational impact\n\nThe open-source demo is ideal for:\n\n- Developers studying L2 interoperability\n- University workshops\n- Hackathons\n- Research on atomic swaps and payment channels\n\nThis strengthens long-term technical capacity in the Cardano community.\n\nd. Foundation for future multi-L2 interoperability standards\n\nThe bridge lays the groundwork for:\n\n- Hydra <-> Hydra multi-hop routing\n- Cross-L2 stablecoin payments\n- Cross-L2 DeFi\n- Interoperability tools for upcoming Cardano L2s\n\nThis prepares Cardano for a multi-L2 future.\n\n**2\\. How we measure impact**\n\nQuantitative indicators\n\n- ≥ 500 successful Lightning <-> Hydra HTLC transactions in demo/test\n- &lt; 2-second latency from Lightning payment to Hydra claim\n- 0 cases of lost funds, validated through full timeout/refund test scenarios\n- ≥ 5 developer/hackathon teams using the toolkit for cross-L2 research\n\nQualitative indicators\n\n- Positive feedback from Hydra and Lightning developers\n- Increased awareness of Cardano’s L2 scalability\n- Mentions of the project in AMAs, workshops, and Hydra technical materials\n\n**3\\.

We felt the same — two years ago, we were deeply curious about this technology and became fascinated by its potential for building high-performance applications.\n\nHowever, Hydra still has several technical challenges, as well as infrastructure and developer tooling gaps, that must be addressed before it can be widely deployed in real-world systems. Over more than a year of research, direct collaboration, and support from our wonderful friends at IOG and within the community, we began building a suite of tools and infrastructure solutions for the Hydra ecosystem, including:\n\n- Hydra SDK (dApp development toolkit for Hydra), available at: [https://hydrasdk\\.com/](https://hydrasdk.com/)\n- Hydra Playground (transaction builder for Hydra dApp development), available at: [https://play\\.hydrasdk\\.com/](https://play.hydrasdk.com/)\n- **Hydra HTLC Demo \\(asset transfer between Hydra Heads\\), open\\-sourced at:** [https://github\\.com/Vtechcom/hydra\\-htlc\\-demo](https://github.com/Vtechcom/hydra-htlc-demo)\n- Hydra Wallet, Hydra Explorer, and experimental game applications, available at: [https://hydrawallet\\.app/](https://hydrawallet.app/)\n- And especially Hydra Hexcore and the Hydra Hub Infrastructure Solution, which provide automated deployment of Hydra Nodes / Hydra Heads, optimized for the lowest operational cost. These are being finalized and prepared for real-world launch at: [https://hydrahub\\.io\\.vn/](https://hydrahub.io.vn/)\n\nThese tools and products are now being adopted by the community and developer teams. Our team supported participants at the Cardano Hackathon Vietnam 2025, and we will continue providing support at the upcoming Cardano Hackathon Asia 2025 – IBW Edition in India ([https://indiablockchainweek\\.com/](https://indiablockchainweek.com/) ) For this event, we provide Hydra Head environments, integration guidance for Hydra SDK, assistance with off-chain/on-chain transaction workflows, and help teams build complete dApps in a short timeframe.\n\nThis experience demonstrates that our team deeply understands Hydra’s architecture, L1–L2 state synchronization mechanisms, and effective smart contract design for Layer 2.\n\nWe also continue to actively explore, debug, propose functional ideas, and contribute code to improve the Hydra protocol alongside the IOG Hydra Core Team: [https://github\\.com/cardano\\-scaling/hydra/issues?q=author%3Aaniadev](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues?q=author%3Aaniadev)\n\nWe are confident this solution is highly feasible because:\n\n- The technology is based on HTLCs, a mechanism already proven on Lightning &amp; Bitcoin. We do not need to reinvent anything — only apply the correct cryptographic design within Hydra.\n- Hydra’s capabilities are ready: full support for events, snapshots, and transaction submission make it ideal for building atomic bridges.\n- Our HTLC demo between Hydra Heads has already been successfully implemented — the hardest part of this project.\n- Lightning regtest &amp; LND APIs are stable, enabling a fast and reliable MVP.\n- Our internal tools (SDK, Playground, Hexcore) significantly accelerate development.\n\nThese provide a strong foundation ensuring that the Lightning &lt;-&gt; Hydra Bridge project is entirely within our team’s current capabilities.\n\nWe commit to a development process that is reliable, transparent, and accountable:\n\n- 100% open-source code on GitHub from day one\n- Milestone-by-milestone reporting with 100% PASS test-case CSV/XLSX results\n- Public demo videos and technical documentation for the community\n- Independent testing via Lightning regtest &amp; Hydra Head environments\n- Clear versioning &amp; releases for each milestone\n- Secure, non-custodial architecture: the bridge never holds user funds","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Milestones","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Project Milestones","description":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":null,"title":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","description":"The number of milestones required depends on the amount of funding requested.

It delivers long-term tooling for the community, enables cross-chain liquidity flow, expands the practical utility of Hydra and Cardano, and lays the foundation for future multi-L2 interoperability.\n\n**Since all project outputs are fully open\\-source and continue providing value long after completion:**\n\n- The HTLC validator on Hydra can be reused for any future cross-L2 application.\n- The Bridge Engine can be extended to additional L2 networks.\n- The demo UI becomes a reusable asset for education, hackathons, and workshops.\n- The documentation &amp; examples accelerate onboarding for new developers.\n- The Docker environment enables the community to run tests in under five minutes.\n\nThis is not a “one-off MVP,” but rather foundational infrastructure that will benefit Cardano and Hydra for many years of development.\n\nWith a total budget of 185,000 ADA ≈ 75,000 USD  the proposal is highly cost-efficient compared to the technical complexity involved, especially considering that the solution requires simultaneous implementation of:\n\n- Aiken HTLC validator (complex smart contract with atomicity and time-lock logic)\n- Lightning Network integration (invoice events, preimage extraction)\n- Hydra orchestration (claim/refund logic, event subscription)\n- Stateless bridge engine\n- Real-time browser UI\n- Full SoM-compliant testing with 100% PASS\n\nThis is a technically demanding project involving two fundamentally different L2 architectures (UTxO &lt;-&gt; eUTxO).

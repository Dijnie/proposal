Yet this transition exposes a serious gap: while Cardano offers strong technology and decentralization, it lacks the user experience and compliance infrastructure that institutions require to participate confidently.\n\n\n\nThe challenge is not theoretical. Global regulatory events - from wallet blacklisting during the Ukraine war to the U.S. ban on Tornado Cash - have shown that the absence of identity and compliance controls in DeFi can turn privacy into risk.\n\n\n\nFor institutional funds, the result is hesitation: an American asset manager trading Cardano-based DeFi with Bitcoin reserves could unknowingly interact with a sanctioned address, facing reputational and legal consequences.\n\nAt the same time, exposing personal data on-chain is unacceptable.\n\nTo resolve this, our project will bridge compliance and decentralization through a modular, KYC-backed UX and identity framework purpose-built for institutional and Bitcoin-native DeFi.\n\n\n\nThe solution unites Sundial’s Bitcoin infrastructure and Fairway’s identity system built on Midnight.\n\nFairway converts verified KYC and real-world credentials into zero-knowledge proofs, allowing on-chain permissioning where access is proven, but personal data remains private.\n\nThis approach ensures Cardano DeFi can remain open and permissionless, while still enabling identity-permissioned user experiences for regulated use cases such as institutional trading, Bitcoin-backed lending, or RWA participation.\n\n### What We Will Build\n1. Institutional Research and Customer InterviewsFairway and Sundial will interview five existing and potential Sundial institutional customers to understand what regulated users expect from Bitcoin-based DeFi.These insights will define the compliance, jurisdictional, and UX standards needed for adoption.\n2. Protocol Evaluation and SelectionBased on that research, we will analyze six Cardano DeFi protocols to identify which are best suited for compliant integration.Two will be selected for pilot implementation, representing distinct DeFi use cases.\n3. Unified UX and Identity FrameworkFairway will design an Identity Center and user flows that merge Bitcoin onboarding and identity verification into one intuitive interface.Users complete KYC once, then receive a Midnight-issued proof that grants or denies access across compatible Cardano dApps — without revealing their personal data.\n4. Integration Layer via BaliusUsing Balius, developed by TxPipe, the framework will handle transaction composition and protocol interaction across the selected DeFi integrations.This creates a reusable backend layer where any project can plug in identity access logic.\n5. Open Framework and ReuseOnce tested and deployed on Cardano mainnet, the architecture, SDKs, and documentation will be published openly, enabling other builders to adopt compliant and user-friendly designs.\n\nFor Sundial, this delivers an institutional-grade user interface for Bitcoin DeFi — a single access point where compliance, usability, and privacy meet.\n\nFor Cardano, it creates a trusted entry layer for institutional Bitcoin liquidity, proving that decentralized finance can meet real-world regulatory and usability standards without sacrificing privacy or decentralization.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"This project lays the groundwork for Bitcoin-native and institutional DeFi adoption on Cardano — creating the clarity, compliance, and user experience needed for real-world financial participation.\n\nToday, Cardano’s infrastructure is ready for innovation, but the user experience and compliance layers remain fragmented. Institutions and professional users are not looking for yield farming dashboards — they are looking for trustworthy, auditable financial rails that meet the same standards as traditional platforms while still preserving the decentralization ethos.\n\nOur framework makes this possible by merging Bitcoin liquidity, institutional trust, and privacy-preserving identity into one consistent user experience.\n\n- - -\n\n\n### 1. Enabling Institutional Bitcoin DeFi\nWith Sundial unlocking Bitcoin liquidity on Cardano, this project ensures that capital can enter the ecosystem safely and compliantly.\n\nInstitutions and Bitcoin holders will be able to access Cardano DeFi through an interface that:\n\n- embeds Fairway’s Midnight-based identity verification,\n- clearly signals which products meet compliance standards,\n- and enforces access rules automatically via zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nThis lowers the perceived risk of on-chain participation, making Cardano an attractive venue for funds, asset managers, and fintechs seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin-backed products.\n\n- - -\n\n\n### 2. Turning DeFi into a Trusted Product Platform\nBy combining modular UX with identity-aware architecture, Cardano DeFi becomes product-ready for professional markets.\n\nThis means:\n\n- Fintech teams can white-label or build on top of the framework to offer compliant crypto services in their jurisdictions.\n- Institutions can manage risk through access-controlled DeFi interactions rather than opaque wallets.\n- Developers can focus on innovation instead of rebuilding compliance infrastructure.\n\nThe result: faster time-to-market for compliant financial apps, stronger institutional confidence, and broader ecosystem adoption.\n\n- - -\n\n\n### 3. Simplified, Unified User Journeys\nFor users, the experience becomes as simple as logging into a traditional financial app — but without surrendering privacy.\n\nThey onboard their Bitcoin once through Sundial, complete a KYC verification through Fairway’s identity layer, and then gain seamless access to Cardano DeFi products across protocols.\n\nNo repeated verifications, no switching between multiple wallets or dApps — just one consistent experience backed by privacy-preserving proofs.\n\n- - -\n\n\n### 4. Ecosystem-Wide Benefits\nThe framework will be open-source, reusable, and modular, providing immediate benefits across Cardano:\n\n- Developers gain access to ready-made UI patterns and SDKs for identity-aware DeFi.\n- Protocols can adopt the standard to attract new, compliant users.\n- Institutions gain a clear, auditable path to participate in Bitcoin-based and Cardano-native DeFi.\n\nThis initiative helps transform Cardano from a network of protocols into a trusted financial platform — bridging the gap between decentralized systems and institutional trust requirements.\n\n- - -\n\n\n### 5. Long-Term Sustainability\nBecause the project is grounded in Sundial’s real institutional user base, the outcomes are not theoretical.\n\nThe pilots and integrations will directly validate product-market fit with real customers.\n\nOnce deployed, the framework remains valuable beyond this proposal:\n\n- Sundial can extend it to production Bitcoin flows.\n- Other DeFi protocols can adopt it without starting from scratch.\n- Fairway can continue maintaining the identity SDK as a shared open component for the ecosystem.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

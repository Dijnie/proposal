Regular Cardano presence\n2. Mentors\n3. Practical guidance for wallets, transactions, staking, or dApps\n\nThis means thousands of potential contributors never reach actual on-chain usage.\n\n\n\nOur Solution: The Keystone Cardano Community Hub\n\nA university-anchored, India-facing hub that provides a clear, repeatable pathway from curiosity → confident Cardano user.\n\nWe deliver this through a recurring cycle of:\n\n1. Cardano 101 sessions\n2. Hands-on workshops\n3. Wallet onboarding clinics\n4. Short bootcamps\n5. Community meetups &amp; a mini-hackathon\n\nInstead of one-off events, the hub runs every semester, onboarding new cohorts and deepening engagement with existing ones.\n\n\n\nWhy a University Hub? (Our Approach)\n\nWe anchor the project within Keystone because:\n\n1. Built-in audience: Thousands of motivated engineering &amp; CS students in one place.\n2. Multipliers: Faculty &amp; student clubs can integrate Cardano into courses and events.\n3. Trust &amp; visibility: A campus setting lowers the barrier for newcomers cautious about crypto.\n\nThis base allows us to expand to partner institutions across India.\n\n\n\nWho the Project Engages\n\n1. Students from engineering, CS, and related fields\n2. Local developers, alumni, and early-career professionals\n3. Educators, technical clubs, and student leaders\n\nOver time, this forms student project teams, developer groups, and micro-communities around Cardano.\n\n\n\nHow the Solution Works (Our Adoption Pathway)\n\nWe take participants through a simple, structured progression:\n\n1. Awareness: Introductory sessions explaining Cardano’s purpose &amp; strengths.\n2. Hands-On Skills: Workshops covering wallet setup, security, transactions, fees, staking basics.\n3. Confident Usage: Clinics and bootcamps where they stake ADA or try beginner-friendly dApps/NFTs.\n\nAt each stage, learning is practical and supervised, not just theoretical.\n\n\n\nHow We Will Demonstrate Impact\n\nWe measure the effectiveness of the Hub using:\n\n1. Number of sessions held\n2. Unique participants reached\n3. Return/retention rates across events\n4. Knowledge improvement (pre/post surveys)\n5. Growth of online community channels\n6. On-chain actions: wallets created, transactions initiated, ADA staked, dApps explored\n\nThese indicators show whether interest is being converted into actual Cardano participation.\n\n\n\nWhat Makes This Solution Unique\n\n1. Long-term presence, not one-off workshops\n2. Campus-based trust, making adoption easier for newcomers\n3. Hands-on, guided onboarding (wallets, transactions, staking)\n4. Peer and mentor networks, not incentives or giveaways\n5. A repeatable model that can be replicated at other universities across India\n\n\n\nWho Benefits\n\n1. Students &amp; developers: Gain practical skills and confidence with on-chain actions\n2. Educators &amp; institutions: Receive ready-made Cardano content and support\n3. Cardano ecosystem: Gains a steady, measurable pipeline of new users, builders &amp; contributors from a huge education market\n\nThe hub becomes a scalable gateway for Cardano adoption across India.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"1.

Direct Spending on Adoption, Not Infrastructure\n    1. Keystone provides classrooms, labs, electricity, internet, and base AV at zero cost, so Catalyst funds are not spent on facilities.\n    2. Nearly the entire 60,000 ADA budget goes toward curriculum design, trainer time, workshops, clinics, bootcamps, community events, and reporting.\n    3. Every ADA contributes directly to creating new wallets, transactions, staking actions, and long-term Cardano users.\n2. Highly Cost-Effective in the Indian Context\n    1. Professional training programs in India typically cost several thousand rupees per participant for only a few days.\n    2. In contrast, this project will engage 300+ unique learners over a full year, with many participating in multiple sessions.\n    3. The cost per learner and cost per onboarded wallet is far below local market rates, especially considering the depth of hands-on guidance and involvement of experienced Cardano mentors.\n3. Reusable Assets That Outlive the Grant\n    1. The largest budget portion is invested in designing high-quality educational materials: Cardano 101 slides, workshop curricula, bootcamp structure, onboarding flows.\n    2. These assets become permanent resources for Keystone and can be reused for future cohorts for years without additional Catalyst funding.\n    3. This makes the project sustainable, repeatable, and scalable beyond the initial grant.\n4. Transparent, Milestone-Linked Spending\n    1. Each spending category maps directly to measurable outputs: events delivered, participants trained, wallets created, and on-chain actions completed.\n    2. There are no hidden costs, no spending on software development, hardware, incentives, airdrops, or speculative activities.\n    3. Third-party expenses are extremely limited (guest mentors, minor AV upgrades, design/video work).\n    4. All costs are tracked transparently with invoices, logs, and milestone reporting.\n5. Long-Term Ecosystem Impact Per ADA\n    1. Instead of a one-time campaign, this investment builds a permanent Cardano presence on a university campus.\n    2. It creates a steady pipeline of new users, developers, and future contributors from one of the world’s largest education markets.\n    3. The impact continues long after funding ends, making this high-ROI, low-waste spending for the ecosystem.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal is a non-technical initiative, with ≤20% of the budget for tech support.","description":"Scope Fit:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal provides verifiable evidence (portfolio, links, reports) of the team's ability to deliver the project.","description":"Relevant Experience:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes clear objectives with both Output Metrics (what proposal did) and Adoption-Focused Metrics (what effect proposal had).","description":"Clear Goals & KPIs:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly explains the user journey and provides a credible plan for how the project will equip and motivate users for future on-chain activity.","description":"Pathway to Adoption:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the initiative clearly demonstrates how it will grow the Cardano ecosystem or onboard users.","description":"Community Value:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the project plan and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic and well-defined.","description":"Realistic Timeline:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal commits to public outputs and justifies any exceptions.","description":"Public Outputs:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget adheres to all policies: it is for future work, follows the merchandise rule, and excludes establishing local treasuries, incentives/giveaways, re-grants.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

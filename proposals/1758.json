Used-car showrooms,\n2. Workshops / garages,\n3. Neutral community spaces in Surakarta and Yogyakarta.\n\nSessions will be framed first around car-buying safety and transparency (pain points they already know), and only then introduce Cardano and Catalyst as governance and trust tools not as “coin trading”.\n\n\n\n**Ambassador recruitment campaigns**\n\n\n\nWe will recruit via:\n\n1. Existing PALAPA customer and partner networks,\n2. Local car clubs and WhatsApp / Telegram groups,\n3.

It needs representation from people whose daily economic life will be impacted by real-world assets, warranties, data registries, and lending products being built on-chain.\n\n\n\nThe used-car sector is:\n\n- Large and high-frequency,\n- Data- and trust-intensive,\n- Full of participants who understand risk, fraud, and long-term value even if they are not “Web3 natives”.\n\n\n\nBy training ambassadors from this sector, Cardano gains:\n\n- Voters and reviewers who judge proposals through a real-world trust and consumer protection lens,\n- Storytellers who can explain Cardano governance in everyday language,\n- A pattern that can later be reused in other verticals (property, logistics, agriculture).\n\n\n\nThis is not just about teaching people to hold ADA. It is about building a human governance interface between Cardano and one of the most trust-challenged industries in Indonesia.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Provide a list of key activities of your project:","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"We group activities into three work-streams:\n\n\n\n**1\\.

documented Community Ambassador model rooted in a real, high-friction sector (used cars), not just abstract Web3 narratives.\n- A trained cohort of ≥ 25 ambassadors and ≥ 100 newly onboarded governance-capable wallets in a key emerging market.\n- An open, bilingual Ambassador Playbook and content pack that other teams can adapt immediately.\n- A stronger integration between Cardano governance and an existing RWA-style operation (CAR-dano / PT Inspeksi Mobil Jogja).\n\n\n\nCompared with the cost of large marketing campaigns or hackathons with diffuse outcomes, this is a focused, lean investment aimed at building **long\\-term governance capacity** where it matters.\n\n\n\nIf successful, this project can:\n\n- Serve as a reference pattern for vertical-specific ambassador hubs

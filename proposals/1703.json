Streamline is designed around the daily reality of CETPs in textile clusters: inlet/outlet sensors, SPCB standards, plant operators, and SPV/association governance. It speaks the language of regulators and plant managers, not just carbon markets.\n- **Edge-to-chain dMRV with RISC-V KarbonNodes:** Most solutions send data to a server and only then hash or batch it onto a blockchain. We are building KarbonNodes with RISC-V SoCs so that data is signed and anchored from the edge device itself before anyone can touch it. This is critical in wastewater, where operator manipulation is a real risk. It’s dMRV starting at the pipe, not in the cloud.\n- **Regulatory compliance and climate credits in one flow:** Water MRV projects either focus on regulatory dashboards or on tokenizing credits, but rarely both. Streamline converts sensor data → compliance status → CO₂e equivalents for avoided pollution, so the same data stream can satisfy SPCB/UNDP compliance reporting, and later feed into carbon/impact credit systems.\n- **Protocol + instance model, already validated with UNDP:** KarbonLedger already has seven bootstrapped modules and Streamline is a named instance of that protocol for CETPs, not a one-off pilot. - We’ve built and demoed the prototype with UNDP India’s SDG Accelerator, and been selected among the Top 10 projects showcased in Copenhagen.So this proposal is not “another idea”; it is taking a working Cardano-based prototype into a live IoT-powered pilot.\n- **Designed as PPP infrastructure, not just a startup product:** Most climate dApps assume a direct B2C or marketplace model. Our design is public–private partnership first. Built with UNDP India and State Pollution Control Boards. Intended to run as Build–Operate–Transfer infrastructure for governments and CETP associations. That governance and deployment model is a big part of the innovation, because it’s what makes long-term adoption realistic in the Global South.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"Our MVP will demonstrate a fully functional digital MRV workflow for wastewater compliance, using simulated IoT data from a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP).

This proves the end-to-end dMRV flow is functioning.\n- **Verified Token Lifecycle Events \\(Smart Contracts\\): **At least 20–50 tokenized lifecycle events (mint/burn/update) recorded from the CET/COT logic in our smart contracts.

It solves the core problem of unreliable and manually reported CETP data by combining IoT sensors, AI models, and blockchain verification into a single, trusted workflow.\n\n\n\nStreamline is not just a dashboard—it is a complete on-chain verification framework for environmental compliance. It is built on top of KarbonLedger, our open, modular climate-tech protocol that we have already bootstrapped and developed across 7 core modules.\n\nThis Catalyst proposal focuses on funding the IoT hardware layer and full pilot deployment, enabling us to turn an already working prototype into a real-world, operational system used by a CETP in India.\n\n\n\n**The Core Idea**\n\nToday, wastewater treatment plants rely on fragmented sensors, manual logbooks, and outdated monitoring systems. This creates data gaps, compliance risk, and no credible way to measure environmental or climate impact.\n\nStreamline fixes this by creating a fully verifiable “**sensor → AI → blockchain**” data pipeline:\n\nIoT sensors collect water quality and energy parameters in real time\n\nKarbonNodes (edge devices) validate and anchor hashed readings to Cardano\n\nAI models detect anomalies and convert pollution reduction into CO₂e impact\n\nStreamline dashboard gives operators and regulators a live compliance view\n\nCardano smart contracts create an immutable audit trail and token events\n\nData becomes trusted, usable by regulators, UNDP, communities, and future climate-finance projects\n\n\n\n**What Catalyst Funding Enables**\n\nWe have already bootstrapped all software modules and demonstrated a working prototype to UNDP India. What remains unfunded is the IoT hardware, KarbonNodes, and installation + pilot execution at a live CETP.\n\n\n\nCatalyst funding will specifically finance:\n\nA. IoT Sensor Module (Primary Ask)\n\nReal-time monitoring of pH, COD, BOD, TDS, DO, flow, sludge and energy\n\nRedundant sensor clusters for credible, regulator-approved data\n\nSecure communication to KarbonNodes\n\nB. Pilot Implementation (Primary Ask)\n\nOn-site deployment at a CETP in India\n\nInstallation, calibration, and operator training\n\nData validation, CO₂e modeling, and full-cycle reporting\n\nCreation of a replicable pilot for UNDP India\n\n\n\nThis makes the project real, measurable, and impactful beyond a prototype.\n\n\n\n**The Streamline dMRV System \\(What We Will Deliver\\)**\n\n\n\n- Live wastewater compliance dashboard\n\nOperators and regulators can view inlet/outlet quality, anomalies, and performance in real time.\n\n- AI-driven CO₂e reduction estimation\n\nWastewater treatment reduces methane and GHG emissions. Our AI models quantify this impact.\n\n- Blockchain-anchored trust layer\n\nAll key events—sensor batches, validations, anomaly alerts, carbon calculations—are anchored to Cardano.\n\n- A full audit trail\n\nRegulators can click and view the on-chain transaction for any compliance event.\n\n- Multi-stakeholder access\n\nCETP operators\n\nSPCB (State Pollution Control Board) regulators\n\nUNDP India\n\nCommunity (public transparency dashboard)\n\n- Future-ready\n\nThe same data pipeline can later interface with carbon-credit registries and universal dMRV systems.\n\n\n\n- KarbonLedger: The Foundation (7 Modules Already Built): Streamline is an instance deployed on top of our climate protocol, KarbonLedger. We have already built and bootstrapped seven modules:\n- Project Registry\n- Verifier/Validator Framework\n- Token Mint/Burn Logic (Aiken smart contracts)\n- Impact Recording Engine\n- Marketplace &amp; Registry UI\n- Carbon Logic Engine (CO₂e modelling)\n- Governance &amp; Roles Module\n\n\n\nThese modules were tested and demonstrated in the UNDP SDG Accelerator and at the Copenhagen Project Showcase.\n\nBecause KarbonLedger is modular, Streamline benefits from a strong, ready backend. Catalyst funds are not used for software development—but to deploy the full IoT + pilot layer over it.\n\n\n\n**Why This Solution Works**\n\n- Streamline addresses the real-world problem effectively because:\n- It removes manual reporting, which is one of the largest sources of compliance failure.\n- It anchors compliance directly on Cardano, eliminating manipulation.\n- It produces regulator-grade evidence that improves trust.\n- It gives UNDP India a replicable model they can scale across other CETPs.\n- It transforms wastewater treatment into measurable climate impact.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"Streamline creates real, on-chain utility for Cardano by turning environmental compliance data into a transparent and verifiable public good.

We are not asking Catalyst to fund research or software R&D—those parts are already built and bootstrapped by our team. The proposal focuses entirely on **IoT hardware, field deployment, and proving Cardano-based dMRV in a live UNDP-backed setting**.\n\n\n\nThis is high value for several reasons:\n\n\n\n### **1. A fully working dMRV use case on Cardano for a global institution**\n\n\n\nThe project creates one of the first **live, regulator-facing Cardano integrations** in Asia, supported by UNDP India. This gives Cardano visibility and credibility beyond the crypto ecosystem.\n\n\n\n### **2. All software modules (7 total) are already built at zero cost to Catalyst**\n\n\n\nKarbonLedger’s registry, verifier logic, Aiken smart contracts, dashboards, carbon engine, and governance modules are complete. Catalyst funding is used only for IoT and deployment—the final piece that unlocks real utility.\n\n\n\n### **3. The pilot establishes Cardano as the backbone for environmental infrastructure**\n\n\n\nA successful CETP deployment demonstrates that Cardano can secure:\n\n\n\n- wastewater compliance\n\n- pollution reduction records\n\n- CO₂e estimation\n\n- SDG-linked environmental data\n\n\n\nThis is new and extremely valuable territory for Cardano.\n\n\n\n### **4. Reusable open-source components for the entire ecosystem**\n\n\n\nThe IoT ingestion library, firmware design, smart contracts, and dMRV logic will be open-sourced. Future climate-tech builders on Cardano can reuse the entire framework without reinventing the wheel.\n\n\n\n### **5. Significant leverage: Catalyst → UNDP → Government expansion**\n\n\n\nA single funded deployment has the potential to expand into:\n\n\n\n- 20–50 CETPs in India\n\n- municipal water systems\n\n- solid waste and renewable energy sectors\n\n- international deployments via UNDP networks\n\n\n\nThis means Catalyst funding has **multiplicative impact**.\n\n\n\n### **6. Transparent, measurable on-chain outputs**\n\n\n\nDuring the pilot, we will generate:\n\n\n\n- 300–500+ on-chain compliance events\n\n- CO₂e impact records\n\n- real-time telemetry-backed proofs\n\n\n\nEvery ADA spent produces a **traceable outcome** visible on Cardano explorers.\n\n\n\n### **7. Strong cost discipline and realistic milestone planning**\n\n\n\nWe carefully split the budget across:\n\n\n\n- IoT hardware\n\n- installation\n\n- calibration\n\n- environmental validation\n\n- reporting\n\n- open-source documentation\n\n\n\nThis keeps costs reasonable for a project involving physical deployment, field engineering, and institutional collaboration.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only; excludes retroactive funding, incentives, giveaways, re-granting, or sub-treasuries.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

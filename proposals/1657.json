The goal is to strengthen the quality, depth, and transparency of governance decision-making by producing structured, public research outputs that can be used by dReps, delegators, and the wider Cardano community.\n\n\n\nThis solution directly addresses the problem of insufficient depth and transparency in governance reviews, while also confronting a critical decentralization challenge: voting power in Cardano governance is highly concentrated among a small number of dReps, many of whom are based in developed countries such as Japan and the United States. While Cardano’s 1 ADA = 1 vote consensus principle is fair in principle, in practice it can lead to imbalances in geographic, economic, and social representation within the decision-making process.\n\n\n\nDrawing on the experience of the Manifesto Cardano Brasil initiative — funded in Project Catalyst Fund 10 — we were able to map the community’s governance-related interests and identify core values considered essential by participants, such as decentralization, honesty, transparency, and knowledge. The project also revealed preferred service types, including discussion groups on social media and in-depth governance action reviews. Through this work, we engaged the community in structured debates, identified local priorities, and built trust through consistent educational outreach. This experience now informs our approach as active dReps, allowing us to operate as scouts of governance information and research, bridging the gap between complex governance processes and the wider community.\n\n\n\nHow It Works\n\nThe project will operate in three main stages:\n\n\n\n1. Research Framework Development\n\nAt project start, a Research Framework Document will be produced, defining:\n\n\n\nCriteria for selecting which GAs and off-chain votes to review.\n\n\n\nPrioritization methodology to ensure high-impact decisions are analyzed first.\n\n\n\nTime allocation standards for research, documentation, and dissemination.\n\n\n\nQuality control measures to ensure consistency and reliability.\n\n\n\nThis stage also includes configuring public repositories (GitHub, Gitbook) and communication channels (Telegram, X) for full transparency.\n\n\n\n2. Continuous Research & Analysis\n\nOver 10 months, the team will conduct in-depth reviews of:\n\n\n\nGovernance Actions (on-chain proposals under CIP-1694).\n\n\n\nBudget Proposals relevant to governance.\n\n\n\nOff-chain Votes, such as Constitutional Committee elections, Intersect governance decisions, and budget bundle selections.\n\n\n\nResearch will be evidence-based, verifying proposers’ track records, delivery history, and technical and financial feasibility.\n\n\n\nEach applicable output will include:\n\n\n\nFull written review in English.\n\n\n\nOn-chain rationale text (EN).\n\n\n\nPublic hosting in GitHub/Gitbook and announcement on social media.\n\n\n\n3. Public Dissemination & Engagement\n\nAll research outputs will be published openly.\n\n\n\nSummarized findings and rationales will be shared on X (Twitter) for accessibility and reach.\n\n\n\nDiscussion channels will gather community feedback, enabling responsive prioritization.\n\n\n\nScope and Flexibility\n\nThis project is designed to be adaptive. Budget estimates are based on historical activity from one year — approx. 70 GAs, ~200 budget proposals, and several dozen off-chain votes. The exact composition of outputs will be adjusted to match real governance demands during execution.\n\n\n\nThis flexibility ensures:\n\n\n\nNo resources wasted on low-relevance reviews.\n\n\n\nPriority given to governance processes with highest impact.\n\n\n\nExpected Outputs\n\n\n\n300 research outputs, delivered in three batches (100 each).\n\n\n\nOutputs are interchangeable between GAs, budget proposals, and off-chain votes.\n\n\n\nAll outputs methodologically consistent, publicly available, and — when applicable — accompanied by on-chain rationale text.\n\n\n\nAddressing the Problem\n\nThis solution tackles the identified issues in four ways:\n\n\n\nDepth of Review – Ensures decisions are informed by thorough, evidence-based research, including background checks, delivery history analysis, and feasibility assessments.\n\n\n\nTransparency – All research and rationales are published openly; concise on-chain rationales are backed by detailed public reports.\n\n\n\nRepresentation – Helps counterbalance geographic and cultural concentration in governance participation by widening access to decision-making insights.\n\n\n\nCapacity Building – Establishes a repeatable, transparent research methodology that can be adopted by other governance actors, strengthening decentralization.\n\n\n\nAdditional Accessibility Efforts\n\nWhile the primary goal is to produce research for the global Cardano community, this proposal also includes — in its pilot phase — the translation of on-chain outputs and selected key off-chain outputs into Brazilian Portuguese. This bilingual component strengthens our global reach while maintaining our social and geographic roots. It also serves a strategic governance goal: contributing to a more equitable distribution of voting power by empowering delegators from underrepresented or developing countries to make informed decisions. Many delegators in these regions currently delegate to already influential dReps or default wallet-recommended pools (such as Eternl’s automatic delegation options), which inadvertently perpetuates governance centralization. By providing accessible, high-quality research in both English and Portuguese, we aim to improve decision quality and diversify representation within Cardano’s governance ecosystem.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"Impact on the Cardano Ecosystem\n\nThis project strengthens Cardano’s governance layer by improving the quality, depth, and transparency of decision-making processes. Its impact will be visible across multiple dimensions:\n\n\n\n1. Higher Quality Decisions\n\nBy producing structured, evidence-based research on Governance Actions, Budget Proposals, and off-chain votes, the project provides dReps, delegators, and the wider community with the information needed to make well-informed decisions.\n\n\n\nIncreases the proportion of votes backed by clear rationale.\n\n\n\nReduces the risk of decisions being made on incomplete or superficial analysis.\n\n\n\n2. Decentralization and Representation\n\nThe project helps counterbalance the current concentration of voting power among a small number of dReps, many located in developed countries.\n\n\n\nExpands access to governance insights for underrepresented communities, including those in developing countries.\n\n\n\nEncourages more diverse delegation choices by improving the visibility of independent dReps.\n\n\n\n3. Accessibility and Engagement\n\nAll outputs will be publicly available, written in clear language, and shared across multiple channels (GitHub, Gitbook, X, Telegram).\n\n\n\nIncreases participation in governance discussions.\n\n\n\nBuilds trust through consistent, transparent communication of voting rationales.\n\n\n\nPilot bilingual publication (English + PT-BR) extends reach to the Portuguese-speaking community, a group with historically limited access to governance content.\n\n\n\n4. Capacity Building for the Ecosystem\n\nThe Research Framework Document will define a repeatable methodology for governance research, including selection criteria, prioritization methods, and quality standards.\n\n\n\nCreates a model that other dReps or governance actors can adopt or adapt.\n\n\n\nEstablishes a public knowledge base for future governance cycles.\n\n\n\nLong-Term Benefits\n\nBy combining methodological rigor, transparent publication, and targeted engagement, this project lays the groundwork for a healthier governance culture in Cardano — one where decisions are more informed, more representative, and more accountable.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

Activities are defined with granularity, underscoring transparent and disciplined resource planning.\n\n\n\nLeveraging AI for Efficiency\n\nWe incorporate AI-assisted translation (e.g., DeepL API) for on-chain and key off-chain outputs, followed by human post-editing.\n\n\n\nProfessional human translation typically costs $0.10–$0.15 per word.\n\n\n\nUsing AI (e.g., DeepL) with human review will reduce the cost to around $0.05 per word — roughly a 50% saving with comparable quality.\n\n\n\nWe also use AI to accelerate drafting of rationales and cross-verification of information, with all outputs reviewed and refined by our team. This saves dozens of hours of human effort, delivering substantial price-performance gains.\n\n\n\nTackling Systemic Issues Around dRep Compensation\n\nThe community acknowledges that dReps should be compensated (as surfaced during Manifesto Cardano Brasil). However, compensation must be justified by quality, consistency, and accountability, not status.\n\n\n\nIn reality, many votes are cast:\n\n\n\nWithout a rationale.\n\n\n\nWith superficial or one-liner justifications.\n\n\n\nWithout full review of Governance Actions.\n\n\n\nVolunteers are more likely to be influenced by lobbying or convenience, especially when complex proposals require significant effort, posing risks to governance integrity.\n\n\n\nThis project avoids volunteer-compensation paradox by tying funding directly to verifiable deliverables, ensuring each dollar spent maps to transparent, high-quality outputs published publicly.\n\n\n\nDeliverables vs. Cost\n\nWe will produce 300 structured research outputs over 12 months, each documented and shared openly.\n\n\n\nOur Statement of Milestones clearly outlines deliverables, criteria, and evidence for each batch—enabling predictable, verifiable, and responsible budget tracking.\n\n\n\nComparing cost per output with international research or translation labor rates shows our model is highly competitive—especially given the depth, bilingual rigor, and governance focus involved.\n\n\n\nLong-Term Ecosystem Value\n\nThe Research Framework we create offers a replicable methodology for transparent governance research—adoptable by future dReps or community groups.\n\n\n\nDelegators gain access to rich analysis, improving the quality of decision-making across the voting pool.\n\n\n\nThe project promotes diversification of representation, giving underrepresented communities tools to participate knowledgeably instead of defaulting to high-power dReps or automated delegation pools.\n\n\n\nIn summary, this proposal ensures excellent value for money by aligning global-standard compensation, AI-driven efficiency, proven methodology, and public transparency to yield governance outcomes that are informed, decentralized, and sustainable.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment

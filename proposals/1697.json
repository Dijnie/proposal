Why Cardano\n\n\n\nRoboLegs relies heavily on trust, transparency, and automated settlement — perfectly suited for Cardano.\n\n\n\n1. UTXO model is ideal for deposit & payment workflows\n\n\n\nDeposits can be locked in dedicated UTXOs\n\n\n\nFees and refunds can be completed in a single transaction\n\n\n\nEasy to verify, immutable, strongly structured\n\n\n\nCompared with EVM escrow contracts, Cardano’s UTXO approach is simpler and safer.\n\n\n\n2. Secure and low-cost for high-frequency transactions\n\n\n\nA rental platform generates many small transactions:\n\n\n\nDeposits\n\n\n\nFee deductions\n\n\n\nRefunds\n\n\n\nStatus logs\n\n\n\nCardano’s low fees and network stability reduce operational cost.\n\n\n\n3. On-chain identity (DID) enables a rental credit system\n\n\n\nFuture integrations:\n\n\n\nOn-chain credit history\n\n\n\nSafety usage score\n\n\n\nOptional identity verification\n\n\n\nIdeal for long-term trust and rental reputation building.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"The project will contribute open-source rental contract templates, an IoT × Web3 reference architecture, and reusable payment modules, enabling more teams to build shared-economy and on-chain verifiable asset-management systems on Cardano.

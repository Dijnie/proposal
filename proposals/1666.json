Existing tools are either closed, single-DEX, or offer only partial insights. Our approach unifies data from multiple DEXs into a transparent, standardized framework that anyone can verify, extend, or integrate into their own applications.

The backend will parse on-chain transactions from major DEX smart contracts, normalize the results into a consistent schema, and store them in a local database. A documented REST API will expose liquidity events, swaps, volumes, and user activity in a reliable and developer-friendly format.\n\n\n\nThis solution directly addresses the current fragmentation and lack of transparency by eliminating the need for custom parsers or closed tools. Developers gain a shared, verifiable data layer they can integrate into dashboards, bots, research, or monitoring tools.

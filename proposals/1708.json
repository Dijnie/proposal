While competitors rely on slow manual processes, high fees, and narrowly define escrow as only a payment step, SmarTrust delivers protection throughout the full lifecycle of work—starting from contract creation to mediation and adjudication. The root cause of disputes lies in the fact that the contract is not clear to start with.\n\nOur platform combines AI-assisted mediation with human adjudication to resolve disputes faster and more fairly than traditional systems, which favors one side mostly.  With smart-contract-powered escrow, payments are locked in up front (in milestones if so desired) and released instantly once both parties agree, ensuring secure, predictable compensation at highly competitive fees.\n\nThe innovation lies in how SmarTrust integrates contract development, automated escrow, and high-quality human adjudication into one seamless solution.  An innovative element is how we incorporate human adjudication in our system, which is something others do not have.  And innovation only becomes true innovation when it is adopted by the market—our own quantitative research confirms strong demand, with over 80% of freelancers wanting exactly this kind of protection and payment assurance.\n\nWhere many competitors build marketplaces and treat escrow as an afterthought, SmarTrust delivers escrow-as-a-service specifically.  By focusing on the workflows freelancers actually value, SmarTrust is positioned to define the standard for fair and secure payments in the future of work. \n\nOur focus is simple: we want to get freelancers to get paid!","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"The MVP will demonstrate how to generate a contract that both parties can agree to, develop the smart contract, fund the smart contract or escrow, and disseminate the funds to the freelancer once the work has been agreed upon by both parties. \n\n\n\nIn addition to this workflow, the freelancer and the buyer will be able to see the tasks that are pending for each party, the invite link, the overview, and overall earnings.

Instead of every team reinventing fragile payment logic, SmarTrust provides a single, secure, open-source foundation for agreements, payouts, disputes, and accountability.\n\nBecause it is chain-native and deterministic, SmarTrust also becomes an ideal fit for Project Catalyst itself. After a proposal is approved, it can be registered as a smart-contracted agreement: Catalyst funds the first milestone, the freelancer delivers, and Catalyst either approves or requests revisions. Once both sides agree, ADA releases automatically. If milestones are missed or work is abandoned, the contract expires and remaining funds return safely to Catalyst. All steps are transparent, predictable, and tamper-proof.\n\nIf disagreements arise, Catalyst can assign its own adjudication team within the system. This ensures fairness while avoiding centralized bottlenecks. It also gives Catalyst a verifiable, auditable trail of work completed, funds released, disputes raised, and outcomes ruled.\n\nBeyond Catalyst, this MVP provides value to the ecosystem as a standalone platform which delivers:\n\nA canonical Aiken escrow template that any marketplace or dApp can reuse.\n\n\n\n\n\nA clean TS SDK, local simulation tools, and examples that reduce developer onboarding time across the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\nA clear demonstration of why Cardano’s eUTXO model is ideal for multi-party economic coordination.\n\n\n\n\n\nA high-quality reference codebase, accelerating Aiken adoption and eliminating months of duplicated engineering across projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 70k ADA, the ecosystem receives a public good along with a hosted platform with real utility for real-world use cases : secure infrastructure that powers real economic activity, strengthens dApp reliability, and creates a practical payment and accountability tool for Catalyst itself.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only;

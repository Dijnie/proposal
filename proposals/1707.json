No current solution effectively merges decentralized identity, AI-driven interview evaluation, and blockchain-anchored credentials specifically tailored for recruitment, highlighting a crucial gap SmartAssess Identity aims to fill by combining these technologies for secure, transparent, and efficient hiring.\n\n\n\n**Centralized Verification Services**\n\n- **Examples:** Equifax, HireRight, Checkr, and Background.com.\n- **Limitations:** (1) Risk of data breaches due to single points of failure. (2) Lack of transparency in decision-making processes. (3) Privacy concerns: data is retained indefinitely. (4) Limited interoperability across platforms.\n\n\n\n**AI\\-Powered Interview Platforms**\n\n- **Examples:** HireVue, Pymetrics, Montage, and Talview.\n- **Limitations:** (1) Assessment scores remain proprietary and cannot be transferred.\n- (2) No blockchain anchoring or credential issuance (3) Candidates cannot indepen dently verify their results. (4) Employers retain assessment data, creating lock-in.\n\n\n\n**Blockchain\\-Based Identity Solutions**\n\n- **Examples:** Sovrin, Veramo, and Trinsic.\n- **Limitations:** (1) Primarily focused on identity, not on interview or skills assessment.\n- (2) Limited integration of AI/ML capabilities.

a clear, realistic budget aligned with tangible deliverables, measurable impact, and a sustainable model.\n\n1. **Budget Efficiency:** The total funding request of ₳180,000 covers a 10-month pilot phase involving 3-4 full-time equivalents, including AI/ML engineer, blockchain specialist, security architect, and project lead. The monthly cost per full-time equivalent is approximately ₳15,000–₳18,000, which is reasonable for specialized technical talent and enterprise-grade software development.\n2. **Tangible Deliverables:** The project commits to delivering a working prototype on Cardano testnet within 10 months, including integration with at least 5 employers, issuance of 50+ verifiable credentials, public open-source, and detailed milestone reports with success criteria. This ensures the vested funding converts directly to usable technology and ecosystem tools.\n3. **Impact Metrics:** The solution addresses a $600 billion annual problem of resume fraud, with a projected 70% reduction in manual verification time (from 15-20 hours to under 5 minutes per hire), leading to substantial cost savings for employers. \n4. **Return on Investment:** Post-pilot, the project projects potential annual revenues between $280,000 to $480,000 from employer subscriptions, verification fees, and institutional licensing, positioning the product on a strong path to profitability and self-sustainability without further Catalyst funding reliance.\n5. **Ecosystem Benefits:** In addition to direct commercial outcomes, the project delivers public goods through open-source developer tools, reusable credential anchoring patterns, and integration templates that grow the Cardano developer ecosystem, multiplying the value beyond the immediate business case.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the funding requested is proportionate to the technical complexity and expected benefits. The project offers Cardano a high return on investment by providing a real-world, enterprise-grade use case, measurable network growth, and a sustainable business model that leverages Catalyst support as a strategic bootstrap rather than ongoing subsidy.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only;

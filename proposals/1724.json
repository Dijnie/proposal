We utilize a multi-channel approach: X (Twitter) for broad awareness, Discord for deep technical support, and direct partnerships with universities/blockchain clubs to funnel talent into the challenges.\n\nWhy this matters for Cardano:\n\nThis project matters because it solves the \"implementation gap\" efficiently. Instead of relying on a single team, we crowdsource solutions, ensuring that for every problem (like IoT SDKs or governance data), the ecosystem gets the best possible solution selected from multiple attempts. It maximizes the ROI of the treasury while keeping 500+ builders actively engaged and earning during a critical building year.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Provide a list of key activities of your project:","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"To execute 12 challenges over 6 months, our key activities include:\n\nInfrastructure & governance setup: Establishing the project hub, Discord server, and recruiting an independent panel of expert judges.\n\nChallenge curation: Designing detailed problem statements, technical requirements, and scoring rubrics for each of the 12 challenges (Dev/Research/Marketing).\n\nCommunity marketing: Promoting challenges through media partners and social channels to ensure a minimum of 500 participants.\n\nOperational support: Managing the submission portal (Google Forms), verifying GitHub commits, and providing technical guidance to participants.\n\nEvaluation & validation: Coordinating the double-blind judging process to select winners based on merit and quality.\n\nDistribution & publishing: Processing prize payouts via multisig and consolidating all 120+ winning submissions into a public open-source library.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What are your success metrics?","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"We measure success through tangible outputs and community engagement:\n\nQuantitative metrics:\n\nParticipation: Engage at least 500 unique builders across 12 challenges.\n\nProduction: Deliver 120+ high-quality submissions (40 codebases/tools, 40 research reports, 40 creative assets).\n\nCost-efficiency: Achieve an average cost per output of ~500 ADA.\n\nQualitative metrics:\n\nUsability: 100% of winning code submissions must be open-source and deployable.\n\nKnowledge transfer: Creation of a centralized \"Cardano builders library\" that remains accessible permanently.\n\nCompliance: Zero disputes regarding prize distribution due to our transparent governance model.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Your Project and Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","description":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","format":null,"answer":"**How do you perceive the problem you are solving?**\n\nWe recognize that the Cardano ecosystem is currently facing three critical bottlenecks hindering widespread adoption and growth in 2025:\n\nThe implementation gap: Despite robust infrastructure, developers still lack standard SDKs and reference code for complex fields like IoT, RWA, and GameFi. The absence of common standards makes dApp building expensive and poses high security risks.\n\nStrategic data void: In the Voltaire era, DReps and investors are forced to make governance decisions based on intuition rather than data. Currently, the ecosystem severely lacks deep-dive reports on capital efficiency, governance performance, and niche market opportunities.\n\nIneffective marketing: Current promotional content is often too academic or too superficial. New users face a significant barrier to understanding core technologies (Mithril, Hydra, eUTXO) due to a lack of intuitive visuals and videos.\n\nFurthermore, the traditional funding model (granting funds to a single team) creates centralized risk. If that team fails, the community wastes resources. We need a crowdsourcing mechanism to stimulate competition and pay only for actual results.\n\n**Our solution: &quot;Cardano builders challenges&quot; \\- 6 months, 12 focused challenges\\.**\n\nWe solve these problems by breaking down large issues into 12 specific challenges, creating a competitive playground to crowdsource the best solutions from the community.\n\nDetailed implementation of 3 tracks:\n\n**_Developer track \\(Solving technical bottlenecks\\):_**\n\nWe present 4 difficult technical problems with strict acceptance criteria:\n\n- IoT SDK: Requires building lightweight transaction construction on edge devices, integrating DID (Atala PRISM), and standardizing sensor metadata.\n- Real world assets (RWA): Focuses on native asset standards, handling dynamic metadata (CIP-68) for fluctuating assets, and integrating legal compliance mechanisms (freeze/KYC).\n- Bridge architecture: Challenges builders to create a secure bridge with multisig/decentralized mechanisms, handling concurrency and UTxO contention.\n- GameFi engine: Optimizes NFT standards (evolving items), integrates Hydra Head for scalability, and implements transaction chaining techniques for a smooth user experience.\n\n**_Research track \\(Providing strategic intelligence\\):_**\n\nWe commission the community to produce 4 deep-dive reports to serve as a knowledge foundation:\n\n- DeFi landscape 2025: Goes beyond TVL to analyze capital efficiency and stablecoin flow shifts, serving as a &quot;bible&quot; for investors.\n- Cardano governance report: Evaluates the Voltaire era, DRep performance, and treasury ROI post-Chang hardfork.\n- Next gen marketplaces: Identifies &quot;blue oceans&quot; for vertical marketplaces (e.g., carbon credits, book rights) rather than competing with general JPG stores.\n- Ecosystem report 2025: A macro report connecting data points (data storytelling) used as a pitch deck to introduce Cardano to VCs and governments.\n\n**_Marketing track \\(Outreach and education\\):_**\n\nLeveraging creativity to simplify technology:\n\n- Tech explainer video: Explains complex concepts (eUTXO, Mithril) in everyday language for newcomers.\n- Authentic journey blog: Shares real stories, genuine emotions, and constructive criticism instead of empty shilling.\n- Ecosystem map: Challenges designers to create an infographic that balances aesthetics with the clarity of the ecosystem structure.\n- Thought leadership threads: Deep analytical threads on X/Twitter to stimulate discussion on RWA, infrastructure, or DeFi.\n\n**Demonstrating impact &amp; beneficiaries:**\n\nFor developers: Access to real-world problems to code and earn worthy rewards.\n\nFor investors/DReps: Access to high-quality reports for decision-making (Research track).\n\nFor new users: Easier access to Cardano concepts through beautiful videos and visuals (Marketing track).\n\n**Unique value proposition:**\n\nThis project turns 60,000 ADA into over 120 output products (submissions). All open source code, reports (PDFs), and media assets will be published in a public library, becoming permanent assets of the Cardano community.

We create a massive open resource library including open source code, in-depth research reports, and marketing materials that anyone in the ecosystem can reuse for free.\n- Human capital activation: The project creates a playground and generates real income for 500 builders over 6 months. This helps retain talent (developers, researchers, creators) within Cardano, especially during quiet market periods.\n\n**Impact measurement methods \\(Quantitative & qualitative KPIs\\):**\n\nWe commit to the following specific metrics:\n\nEngagement:\n\n- Attract a minimum of 500 builders to participate in solving challenges.\n- Collaborate with 20 media partners to spread the challenges to the global community.\n- Output production: Collect a total of 120 high-quality products (submissions) verified by the jury, including:\n- 40+ technical solutions: (SDKs, tools, smart contracts) stored on GitHub.\n- 40+ research reports: (Market research, data analysis) in PDF/docs format.\n- 40+ creative content pieces: (Videos, infographics, blogs) published on social networks.\n\nQuality:\n\n- 100% of winning products must pass technical review (code review) or content appraisal by the expert jury council.\n\n**Sharing outputs and project results:**\n\nWe ensure transparency and permanent accessibility for the community:\n\n- Centralized repository: All 120 products will be uploaded to a public website/Notion hub. Developer source codes will be available on GitHub with MIT/Apache 2.0 licenses.\n- Monthly showcase: At the end of each month, we will aggregate winning entries into a newsletter and recap video so the community can see how effectively the budget is being utilized.\n- Demo day: The most outstanding solutions from the Developer track and Research track will be invited to present in a livestream to connect with venture capitals (VCs) or large projects currently hiring.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

Community bounties (Compliance with fund rules regarding bounty programs) - 40,000 ADA\n\nRepresents 67% of the total budget. These are direct payments for tangible outputs, strictly following a structured bounty governance model.\n\nDev track bounties (4 challenges): 4,000 ADA/challenge × 4 = 16,000 ADA\n\n(Value: ~$1,600/technical problem. Rewards for code/SDKs/smart contracts).\n\nResearch track bounties (4 challenges): 3,000 ADA/challenge × 4 = 12,000 ADA\n\n(Value: ~$1,200/report. Rewards for market research/data analysis).\n\nMarketing track bounties (4 challenges): 3,000 ADA/challenge × 4 = 12,000 ADA\n\n(Value: ~$1,200/campaign. Rewards for video/content creators).\n\n2.

High return on investment (ROI):\n\nWith a budget of 60,000 ADA, we commit to delivering over 120 finished products (submissions).\n\nThis equates to an average cost of only 500 ADA (~$200) per high-quality output (whether it is an SDK, a deep-dive report, or a video).\n\nThis cost is significantly lower than traditional outsourcing or funding a full-time team, as we leverage the competitive nature of the gig economy.\n\n2. Strict financial compliance (Pay-for-success):\n\nThis proposal is designed as a structured bounty program, fully compliant with fund rules:\n\n67% of the budget (40,000 ADA) goes directly to the community builders.\n\nWe operate on a \"no cure, no pay\" basis. Prize money is only released when a submission meets the strict acceptance criteria. The treasury does not pay for failed attempts or empty promises.\n\n3. Human capital activation:\n\nBeyond the digital assets produced, this budget effectively sustains the engagement of 500 skilled builders for 6 months. We are paying to keep talent active, learning, and contributing to Cardano during a critical growth year, preventing brain drain to other chains.\n\n4. Lean operational costs:\n\nThe management fees are kept to a minimum (Project lead at ~$600/month) to maximize the prize pool for the community.

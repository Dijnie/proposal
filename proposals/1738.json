Who are the Targets for Blockchain Summit 2026?\n\n\n\nThe Blockchain Summit 2026 is designed to attract a highly specialized and influential audience, primarily focused on institutional finance, regulation, and large-scale adoption.\n\n\n\nKey target demographics include:\n\n*   **Decision-Makers and Innovators:** The summit is unique because it brings together the **builders, investors, regulators, and institutions actually driving the space forward**.\n\n*   **Financial Institutions and Investors:** The event is designed for both **Japanese and international founders, investors, and financial institutions** to engage deeply on real-world use cases.\n\n*   **Regulators and Banks:** A key objective of the summit is **convening regulators and institutions**—specifically bringing together **regulators, banks, investors and founders** to co-design compliant, scalable digital financial infrastructure.\n\n*   **Industry Experts:** The event will gather **300+ experts from Japan and Asia**.\n\n*   **Collaborators:** Attendees include **Major banks, brokers, and Fintechs** who are collaborating on real-world asset tokenisation and stablecoin trials.\n\n\n\nThe conversations at the summit will be centered on the Japan opportunity but also stretch beyond borders to discuss the latest happenings across Southeast Asia, Korea, the Middle East, and the United States of America.\n\n\n\n### 2. How the Targets Will Be Reached\n\n\n\nCardano's engagement with these targets is facilitated through securing the Gold Sponsorship and leveraging the strategic context of the event:\n\n\n\n*   **Direct Speaking Platform:** The Gold Sponsorship tier provides **one (1x) Panel Speaker Slot** (from conversation history), which is the direct mechanism for Cardano representatives to introduce Cardano into the \"breaking conversation in a major and loud way\" (from conversation history).\n\n*   **Exclusive Networking:** The summit is an **invite-only forum** within Japan Fintech Week. This structure ensures **Curated Connections** where meaningful partnerships form across institutions, innovators, and investors.\n\n*   **Brand Credibility and Visibility:** By being a Gold Sponsor, Cardano's brand gains entitlement and visibility, including logo placement on the **stage-backdrop** and **on-site event banners** (from conversation history). This places Cardano in association with major partners like **CREDIT SAISON** and **Pacific Meta**.\n\n*   **Strategic Location:** The summit is held at the Tekko Building in **Marunouchi, the \"Wall Street\" of Tokyo**, ensuring interaction happens within the physical center of Japan's financial industry.\n\n\n\n### 3. Why This Engagement Matters for Cardano\n\n\n\nSecuring a major presence at the Blockchain Summit 2026 is strategically important for Cardano because it directly addresses the problem of Cardano being \"out of discussion in the broader circle of cryptocurrencies and blockchains, especially in the front of further adoption by institutions and enterprises\" (from conversation history).\n\n\n\nThe key strategic implications are:\n\n\n\n#### Accessing a Ready Institutional Market\n\n*   **$6 Trillion Opportunity:** Japan, as the world's third-largest economy, is at an \"once-in-a-generation inflection point\" with a **vast pool of financial assets ready for tokenisation**, representing an opportunity of **over US$6 trillion**.\n\n*   **Regulatory Testbed:** Japan leads Asia in clear digital asset rules and is pairing **regulatory clarity with institutional readiness**, creating the **most credible testbed for tokenised finance in Asia**. This focus on compliant and scalable infrastructure is vital for institutional adoption.\n\n*   **Alignment with Institutional Themes:** The key themes of the summit are directly relevant to Cardano’s ambition to serve enterprise needs, focusing on **Tokenised Assets & Institutional Markets**, and **Stablecoins & Digital Currency Adoption**.\n\n\n\n#### Building Institutional Trust and Pathway to Adoption\n\n*   **Co-host Support:** The summit is co-hosted with **Pacific Meta**, which is the largest Tokyo-based Web3 accelerator and has provided **blockchain-related consulting to major local institutions**. Associating with such a credible local partner is crucial for navigating the Japanese market.\n\n*   **Bridging Institutional Strength and Innovation:** The event serves to **unite Japan’s institutional strength with global blockchain innovation**, creating a trusted bridge for real-world assets and stablecoins.\n\n*   **Pathway to On-Chain Activity:** This initiative aligns with Project Catalyst goals by demonstrating a **Pathway to Adoption**. By connecting Cardano with regulators and financial institutions at this high-level forum, the project aims to equip the ecosystem to enable future **on-chain activity** at the enterprise level.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Provide a list of key activities of your project:","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"### Key Thematic Discussions\n\n\n\nThe central activity of the summit involves discussions centered around four major themes driving the future of finance:\n\n\n\n1.  **Payments & Cross-Border Settlements:** Discussions will focus on how on-chain payments are redefining remittances, trade finance, and FX to create faster, cheaper, and interoperable rails across Asia and beyond.\n\n2.  **Digital Infrastructure & Market Connectivity:** Activities cover everything from core blockchain networks to custody, identity, and compliance layers that power new infrastructure across digital finance ecosystems.\n\n3.  **Stablecoins & Digital Currency Adoption:** Experts will discuss how clear rules are enabling regulated stablecoins, thereby bridging traditional finance with programmable money and on-chain liquidity.\n\n4.  **Tokenised Assets & Institutional Markets:** The core conversation involves how tokenization unlocks liquidity and access—from private credit to T-Bills—and transforms the creation and distribution of financial products.\n\n\n\nThese conversations are centered on the **Japan opportunity** but will also discuss the latest happenings across Southeast Asia, Korea, the Middle East, and the United States of America.\n\n\n\n### Transformational and Networking Activities\n\n\n\nThe organizers intend the Blockchain Summit to be \"transformational\" by focusing on three structural activities designed for **maximum impact** and **connections that last**:\n\n\n\n1.  **Convening Regulators and Institutions:** The summit's primary function is to bring **regulators, banks, investors and founders** together. This activity aims to **co-design compliant, scalable digital financial infrastructure**.\n\n2.  **Curated Connections:** The event is an **invite-only forum** within Japan Fintech Week, structured specifically so that **meaningful partnerships form** across institutions, innovators, and investors.\n\n3.  **Bridging Japan and the World:** The summit works to unite Japan's institutional strength with global blockchain innovation, thereby creating a trusted bridge for real-world assets and stablecoins. The conference will include live translation between Japanese and English.\n\n\n\nThe goal of the summit is to gather **300+ experts from Japan and Asia** to discuss the future of Stablecoins, Tokenized Assets, and RWAs (Real World Assets).\n\n\n\n### Cardano's Engagement Activity\n\n\n\nCardano's proposed involvement via the Gold Sponsorship directly secures a key activity within the event schedule: **one (1x) Panel Speaker Slot** [17, 18, Conversation History]. This activity allows Cardano representatives to directly participate in the high-level industry discussions mentioned above [Conversation History].","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What are your success metrics?","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"The following are the main success metrics relevant to Cardano:\n\n- Pre-registration count: 1,000 people\n- Attendance: 300+\n- Event attendee satisfaction: 4.0/5.0\n\nFurther more, the event should achieve the following qualitative goals:\n\n- Relationship Building: Build relationships by inviting them to the event. Targeted sales to participants.\n- Top-of-mind awareness: Increase the probability of being remembered by creating a memorable event\n- Trust: Gain trust primarily from participants by making it an event with a certain scale and prestige","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Your Project and Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","description":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","format":null,"answer":"The proposed solution is securing the **Gold Sponsorship** tier for Cardano at the **Blockchain Summit 2026** in Tokyo, Japan.\n\n### The Problem\nThe core issue this initiative seeks to address is **Cardano being out of discussion in the broader circle of cryptocurrencies and blockchains, especially in the front of further adoption by institutions and enterprises**.\n\n### The Proposed Solution: Gold Sponsorship\nThe solution involves funding the Gold Sponsorship for the Blockchain Summit 2026, which requires an investment of **25,000 USD** (or 3,800,000 JPY). The aim is to &quot;Introduce Cardano into this breaking conversation in a major and loud way, building connections with the other key players in the blockchain community and among institutional institutions&quot;.\n\nThe Gold Sponsorship package includes several key entitlements:\n\n- Speaking Opportunity: One (1x) Panel Speaker Slot\n- Passes: Four (4x) Passes\n- Branding: Logo on event website, Luma page, stage-backdrop, and on-site event banners\n- Promotion: Announcement on eDM and an Emcee shout-out\n\nThe Blockchain Summit is a one-day event taking place on February 25, 2026, at the Tekko Building in Tokyo, Japan, in the Marunouchi area, often referred to as the &quot;Wall Street&quot; of Tokyo. The event is part of Japan Fintech Week 2026 and is powered by CREDIT SAISON and Pacific Meta.\n\n### How the Solution Addresses the Problem\nThe solution addresses Cardano's lack of presence in institutional discussions by targeting a high-impact, institutionally-focused event in a critical region for tokenized finance.\n\n1. Targeting Institutional Adoption\n\nThe Blockchain Summit 2026 is specifically designed to bring together **builders, investors, regulators, and institutions actually driving the space forward**. It is explicitly designed for Japanese and international investors and **financial institutions** to engage deeply on real-world use cases. The conference is set to gather 300+ experts from Japan and Asia.\n\nThe event emphasizes:\n\n- **Convening Regulators and Institutions:** The summit brings together regulators, banks, investors, and founders to co-design compliant and scalable digital financial infrastructure.\n- **Curated Connections:** It is an invite-only forum within Japan Fintech Week where meaningful partnerships form across institutions, innovators, and investors.\n- **Key Themes:** The summit's discussions align perfectly with the goal of increasing enterprise adoption, focusing on topics such as Stablecoins &amp; Digital Currency Adoption, and **Tokenised Assets &amp; Institutional Markets**.\n\n2. Providing Direct Engagement\n\nBy securing the Gold Sponsorship, Cardano gains a **Panel Speaker Slot**. This enables Cardano representatives to directly participate in the &quot;breaking conversation&quot; alongside key industry players, investors, and regulatory bodies. This direct involvement is crucial for inserting Cardano into the institutional discussion that it is currently &quot;out of&quot;.\n\n3. Enhancing Brand Visibility in a Credible Environment\n\nThe sponsorship provides significant brand entitlement and visibility, including logos on the stage-backdrop, event website, and banners. This ensures that Cardano's brand is prominently displayed at an event co-hosted by the leading blockchain accelerator in Japan, Pacific Meta, which has experience supporting major projects and providing consulting to major local institutions. Japan itself is described as the world's third-largest economy, offering a vast pool of financial assets ready for tokenization (a $6T market opportunity), making it a credible testbed for tokenized finance in Asia.\n\nIn essence, positioning Cardano as a Gold Sponsor is intended to move Cardano from being absent in institutional discussions to being a visible, present, and participating voice within a strategically important, regulatory-ready, institutional forum.\n\n- - -\n\n\nThe proposed solution acts like purchasing a dedicated booth and speaking spot at a high-level trade expo that only top industry executives and government officials attend. Instead of shouting messages into the general cryptocurrency crowd, the sponsorship ensures Cardano is standing directly among the key decision-makers (banks, regulators, and large institutions) who can facilitate real-world, enterprise-level adoption.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"The proposed project, securing Gold Sponsorship for Cardano at the Blockchain Summit 2026, is designed to have a significant **positive impact on the wider Cardano community** primarily by driving enterprise adoption, expanding Cardano's global footprint, and increasing the ecosystem's credibility in key financial markets.\n\n\n\nThis positive impact is defined by achieving objectives that align directly with the criteria for demonstrating **Community Value** and establishing a **Pathway to Adoption**.\n\n\n\n### 1. Driving Enterprise Adoption and Expanding Global Footprint\n\n\n\nThe project directly addresses the problem of Cardano being \"out of discussion in the broader circle of cryptocurrencies and blockchains, especially in the front of further adoption by institutions and enterprises\" [Conversation History]. The positive impact lies in forcing Cardano into this conversation:\n\n\n\n*   **Accessing the $6 Trillion Opportunity:** By positioning Cardano at the Blockchain Summit, the project aims to tap into Japan's vast pool of financial assets ready for tokenization, representing **over US$6 trillion**. Success in this market translates to major potential on-chain activity for the entire Cardano ecosystem.\n\n*   **Targeting the Right Audience:** The summit is specifically designed to bring together **builders, investors, regulators, and institutions actually driving the space forward**. The positive impact is ensuring Cardano is introduced to these key players **in a major and loud way, building connections with the other key players** [Conversation History]. This fulfills the requirement to explain how the initiative will **grow Cardano’s ecosystem** and **expand its global footprint**.\n\n*   **Focusing on Core Needs:** The summit's key themes—such as **Tokenised Assets & Institutional Markets** and **Stablecoins & Digital Currency Adoption**—are vital areas for institutional growth. The project places Cardano directly in discussions relevant to compliant, scalable digital financial infrastructure.\n\n\n\n### 2. Enhancing Credibility and Regulatory Readiness\n\n\n\nThe project's success enhances the ecosystem's credibility, which is vital for attracting future developers, enterprises, and users:\n\n\n\n*   **Association with Institutional Partners:** The summit is co-hosted with **Pacific Meta**, the largest Tokyo-based Web3 accelerator that has provided **blockchain-related consulting to major local institutions**. It is also powered by **CREDIT SAISON** and is part of **Japan Fintech Week 2026** (organized by the Japan Financial Services Authority). Associating Cardano with these highly credible financial and regulatory entities validates the ecosystem for institutional partners.\n\n*   **Navigating Regulatory Clarity:** Japan is considered the **most credible testbed for tokenised finance in Asia** because it is pairing **regulatory clarity with institutional readiness**. By participating (via the Panel Speaker Slot [17, 18, Conversation History]), Cardano demonstrates its commitment to operating within regulated, established financial frameworks.\n\n*   **Bridging Institutional Strength:** The summit aims to **unite Japan's institutional strength with global blockchain innovation**. Cardano's presence helps cement its position as a trusted bridge for real-world assets and stablecoins.\n\n\n\n### 3. Establishing a Pathway to On-Chain Activity\n\n\n\nThe investment lays the necessary groundwork (the \"Pathway to Adoption\" requirement) for future on-chain activity for the community:\n\n\n\n*   **Enabling Future Enterprise Use Cases:** By engaging banks, regulators, and fintechs, the project prepares the groundwork for institutions to utilize the Cardano blockchain for tokenization, stablecoin trials, and digital infrastructure. Future on-chain activity from these major players will benefit the entire community through increased network usage, transaction fees, and exposure.\n\n*   **Providing Public Outputs:** While the Gold Sponsorship specifically covers branding and a speaking slot, the commitment to public outputs (such as event reports or educational content derived from the summit engagement) is a requirement for strong proposals. These outputs can be used by the wider community (educators, marketers, content creators) to promote Cardano's institutional readiness globally.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the positive impact on the Cardano community is the strategic elevation of the ecosystem's standing from being absent in high-level discussions to being a recognized, credible player actively seeking to enable **multi-trillion dollar tokenized finance opportunities** through regulatory engagement and institutional partnerships.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

The feasibility of the approach is validated by the organizers' strategic positioning within the Japanese institutional and regulatory landscape.\n\n\n\n### Capability of Organizers to Deliver the Summit\n\n\n\nThe trust and accountability of the organizers are strongly supported by their identity and demonstrated experience:\n\n\n\n#### 1. Association with Major Financial and Regulatory Institutions\n\n\n\nThe Blockchain Summit is powered by and associated with significant, credible entities:\n\n\n\n*   **Powered By:** The summit is powered by **CREDIT SAISON** and **Pacific Meta**.\n\n*   **Part of Japan Fintech Week:** The event is part of **Japan Fintech Week 2026**. This week of events is organized by the **Japan Financial Services Authority**. This direct link to the primary financial regulator provides a high level of legitimacy and institutional focus.\n\n\n\n#### 2. Expertise of Co-Host Pacific Meta\n\n\n\nThe Blockchain Summit is **co-hosted with the leading blockchain accelerator in Japan: Pacific Meta**. Pacific Meta's verifiable experience indicates strong organizational capability and institutional trust:\n\n\n\n*   **Scale and Team:** Pacific Meta is the **largest Tokyo-based Web3 accelerator**, featuring **over 30 full-time professionals**.\n\n*   **Institutional Consulting:** Pacific Meta has **provided blockchain-related consulting to major local institutions**.\n\n*   **Project Support:** They have **supported 150+ projects** across 23 countries, aiding protocols and brands to localize, launch, and grow in the Japanese Web3 market.\n\n*   **High-Profile Collaborations:** Pacific Meta has **facilitated high-profile collaborations** such as STEPN GO x G-SHOCK (Casio), linking Web3 communities with Japanese iconic brands like **CASIO** and **KDDI**.\n\n*   **Event Track Record (IRL Achievements):** Pacific Meta has a proven history of organizing **100+ events** with **10,000+ total participants**.\n\n\n\n### Validation of Feasibility\n\n\n\nThe organizers intend to validate the feasibility of their approach by ensuring the summit is strategically timed and targeted toward a specific, ready market with regulatory support. The validation hinges on three core pillars:\n\n\n\n#### 1. Strategic Timing and Market Opportunity\n\n\n\nThe organizers assert that Japan is at an **\"once-in-a-generation inflection point\"**. This timing validates the feasibility of achieving high impact by focusing on:\n\n\n\n*   **$6 Trillion Market:** Japan is the world's third-largest economy, with **over US$6 trillion in financial assets ready for tokenisation**. This substantial market size makes a targeted event feasible and highly desirable for institutional attendees.\n\n*   **Regulatory Clarity:** Japan leads Asia in clear digital asset rules, having **enacted stablecoin legislation** and expanded tokenized securities sandboxes. This regulatory foundation ensures that the discussions around **Tokenised Assets & Institutional Markets** and **Stablecoins & Digital Currency Adoption** are practical and actionable, ensuring that the event brings together **regulators and institutions** to co-design compliant infrastructure.\n\n\n\n#### 2. Curated and Targeted Audience\n\n\n\nThe event’s structure validates its approach by eliminating casual attendance in favor of high-value connections:\n\n\n\n*   **Invite-Only Forum:** The summit is an **invite-only forum** within Japan Fintech Week, ensuring **Curated Connections** where meaningful partnerships form across institutions, innovators, and investors. This selective nature validates that the goal of bringing together the **builders, investors, regulators, and institutions actually driving the space forward** is feasible.\n\n*   **Focus on Real-World Use Cases:** The Blockchain Summit is specifically designed for both Japanese and international investors and financial institutions to engage **deeply on real-world use cases**.\n\n\n\n#### 3. Institutional Collaboration\n\n\n\nThe feasibility is demonstrated by existing high-level collaboration between major players:\n\n\n\n*   **Institutions Meet Innovation:** The event's premise is validated by the fact that **Major banks, brokers, and Fintechs are already collaborating** on real-world asset tokenisation and stablecoin trials, thereby accelerating market adoption. The summit aims to **unite Japan's institutional strength with global blockchain innovation**.\n\n\n\nThe capability of the organizers, built on the foundations of the Japan Financial Services Authority's backing, the financial credibility of CREDIT SAISON, and the proven execution history of Pacific Meta, strongly suggests they can deliver the summit with high accountability and trust.

Access to the $6 Trillion Japanese Market Opportunity\n\n\n\nThe sponsorship secures Cardano's presence at a pivotal moment in the world's third-largest economy:\n\n\n\n*   **Targeting Financial Institutions:** The summit is designed for both Japanese and international investors and **financial institutions** to engage deeply on real-world use cases. Securing Gold Sponsorship ensures Cardano is present at this exclusive forum.\n\n*   **Tokenization Focus:** Japan is described as being at an \"once-in-a-generation inflection point,\" pairing regulatory clarity with institutional readiness to create the most credible testbed for tokenized finance in Asia. The market opportunity for financial assets ready for tokenization in Japan is over **US$6 trillion**. The summit's key themes explicitly include **Tokenised Assets & Institutional Markets**.\n\n*   **Strategic Location:** The event is held at the Tekko Building in Marunouchi, known as the **\"Wall Street\" of Tokyo**. This location directly places Cardano's brand in the epicenter of Japan's financial industry.\n\n\n\n### 2. Direct Engagement with Key Decision-Makers\n\n\n\nThe Gold Sponsorship package includes critical entitlements that facilitate direct relationship-building and influence:\n\n\n\n*   **Speaking Opportunity:** The sponsorship includes **one (1x) Panel Speaker Slot**. This provides Cardano representatives a crucial platform to introduce Cardano into the discussion in a \"major and loud way\" and build connections with key players, investors, regulators, and financial institutions.\n\n*   **Targeted Audience:** The summit aims to gather **300+ experts from Japan and Asia** and is focused on bringing together **builders, investors, regulators, and institutions actually driving the space forward**. This focus ensures that the investment reaches the specific audience necessary to drive enterprise adoption, addressing the problem of Cardano being \"out of discussion\" in these circles.\n\n*   **Curated Connections:** The summit is an **invite-only forum** within Japan Fintech Week, specifically designed for meaningful partnerships to form across institutions, innovators, and investors.\n\n\n\n### 3. Enhanced Credibility and Association\n\n\n\nThe sponsorship investment buys association with highly credible partners and established industry organizations:\n\n\n\n*   **Co-Hosting Credibility:** The Blockchain Summit is co-hosted with **Pacific Meta**, which is described as the largest Tokyo-based Web3 accelerator. Pacific Meta has supported over 150 projects, provided **blockchain-related consulting to major local institutions**, and facilitated high-profile collaborations with Japanese brands like CASIO and KDDI.\n\n*   **Association with Major Networks:** The event is powered by **CREDIT SAISON** and Pacific Meta, and is part of the broader **Japan Fintech Week 2026**, which is organized by the Japan Financial Services Authority. This association lends significant legitimacy and regulatory context to Cardano’s presence.\n\n*   **Brand Entitlement:** The Gold Sponsorship ensures Cardano's logo is visible on the **stage-backdrop** and **on-site event banners**, reinforcing its status as a major participant within this institutional context.\n\n\n\n### Alignment with Catalyst Goals\n\n\n\nFrom the perspective of a Project Catalyst funding mechanism (Cardano Open: Ecosystem), this investment aligns with the category's goal of funding non-technical initiatives, such as **community events** and **local advocacy**, that drive ecosystem growth, broaden Cardano’s reach, and demonstrate a clear **Pathway to Adoption**. By connecting Cardano with regulators and financial institutions (convening to co-design compliant, scalable digital financial infrastructure), the investment facilitates the crucial step of demonstrating how Cardano can enable future on-chain activity at the institutional level.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal is a non-technical initiative, with ≤20% of the budget for tech support.","description":"Scope Fit:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal provides verifiable evidence (portfolio, links, reports) of the team's ability to deliver the project.","description":"Relevant Experience:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes clear objectives with both Output Metrics (what proposal did) and Adoption-Focused Metrics (what effect proposal had).","description":"Clear Goals & KPIs:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly explains the user journey and provides a credible plan for how the project will equip and motivate users for future on-chain activity.","description":"Pathway to Adoption:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the initiative clearly demonstrates how it will grow the Cardano ecosystem or onboard users.","description":"Community Value:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the project plan and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic and well-defined.","description":"Realistic Timeline:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal commits to public outputs and justifies any exceptions.","description":"Public Outputs:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget adheres to all policies: it is for future work, follows the merchandise rule, and excludes establishing local treasuries, incentives/giveaways, re-grants.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/yesNoChoice","title":"Have you previously submitted a project in Catalyst that was funded and is not yet completed?","description":"Do you have not yet completed projects?","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/tagInput","title":"Project ID's","description":"If you answered “yes” to the previous question, please select first how many there are in total and then list all IDs for any projects you are currently involved in that have not been completed yet.","format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":null,"title":"Project ID","description":"Seven digit project ID from Catalyst website","format":null,"answer":"1400028","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

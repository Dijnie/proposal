RugbyFundX records all contributions on-chain, enabling real-time tracking and verifiable fund allocation. Contributors can see exactly which milestones funds are applied to, from player equipment to tournament participation.\n\n\n\nSponsor Engagement and Measurable ROI: Brands investing in rugby players or teams lack measurable outcomes for their contributions. RugbyFundX integrates sponsors into the platform, enabling players to promote products and services as part of campaign agreements. Smart contracts automatically track contributions and related sponsor activations, providing clear, quantifiable results.\n\n\n\nHow the Solution Works:\n\n\n\nFans and sponsors contribute ADA directly to smart contracts associated with players or clubs.\n\n\n\nFunds are locked and only released upon achieving predefined milestones (e.g., completion of training programs, tournament participation).\n\n\n\nContributors can track progress and fund allocation through a transparent dashboard.\n\n\n\nPlayers participate in brand promotion activities as agreed with sponsors, and interactions are verified on-chain.\n\n\n\n The platform ensures trust and accountability in rugby fundraising, empowers players with secure support, and provides measurable impact for sponsors  all while generating meaningful on-chain activity on Cardano.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"RugbyFundX will have several positive impacts on the broader Cardano ecosystem:\n\n\n\nIncreased On-Chain Activity: Every contribution, milestone approval, and sponsor interaction is recorded on-chain, generating a measurable increase in Cardano network transactions and activity.\n\n\n\nExpanded Use Cases for Cardano: By applying blockchain technology to sports crowdfunding, RugbyFundX demonstrates the versatility of Cardano for real-world applications beyond NFTs and financial transactions.\n\n\n\nEnhanced Trust and Transparency: Contributors, sponsors, and the community can verify all transactions and fund allocation, promoting trust in decentralized finance and project management on Cardano.\n\n\n\nCommunity Engagement and Growth: The platform encourages interaction between fans, players, and sponsors, fostering a strong, engaged community around sports projects on Cardano.\n\n\n\nEducation and Adoption: RugbyFundX serves as a practical example for other sports and social initiatives considering blockchain solutions, potentially driving broader adoption and understanding of Cardano's smart contract capabilities.\n\n\n\nSupport for Decentralized Funding Models: By providing a transparent, trustless crowdfunding platform, RugbyFundX reinforces the ethos of decentralization and accountable funding within the Cardano ecosystem.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

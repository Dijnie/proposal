On\\-Chain Performance & Utility Metrics**\n\nThese metrics demonstrate to Cardano community that the platform is **driving actual network usage and burning ADA through transaction fees, rather than just speculation\\.**\n\n\n\n- **Hydra\\-Powered Finality** (<5s): Success is measured by achieving bid confirmation times of under 5 seconds. This proves Cardano/Hydra can match the speed of centralized Web2 servers, a critical milestone for enterprise adoption.\n- **High Throughput Stability**: The system must sustain 1000+ qualified bids per auction without performance degradation. This stress-tests Hydra Heads in a live commercial environment.\n- **Transaction Volume**: Success is defined by the volume of on-chain transactions generated from every bid, NFT mint, and asset transfer.\n- **Asset Tokenization \\(RWA on Cardano\\)**: The number of physical state assets (cars, real estate) successfully converted into NFTs on Cardano with verifiable IPFS metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n**2\\. Adoption & Ecosystem Growth**\n\nThese metrics quantify the influx of new users and capital into the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n- \n- **New Active Wallets: **Onboarding traditional government auction participants (who are typically non-crypto natives) as new Cardano wallet holders.

Strategic & Financial Success**\n\nThese measures appeal to the long-term value proposition for ADA holders.\n\n\n\n- **100% Immutable Trust**: Achieving a tamper-proof audit trail where every single bid is logged on-chain. This eliminates \"shill bidding\" and fraud, offering a superior product to current centralized alternatives.\n- **Cost Efficiency**: Demonstrating a significant reduction in per-auction operating costs compared to the current industry average of ~$80 per session. Lower costs drive competitive advantage and sustainability.\n- **Global Replicability**: Delivering a \"blueprint\" model that is regulation-ready and can be exported to other countries, positioning Cardano as the standard for government-grade asset auctions.\n\n\n\n**🍀Prove it via a Scopus\\-indexed scientific research paper🍀**","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Your Project and Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","description":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","format":null,"answer":"📌 Key Problems to Solve\n\n🍀 Fraud &amp; Manipulation – Shill bidding, phantom bids, and bid sniping erode trust in state auctions.\n\n🍀 Opaque Systems – Centralized platforms allow server-side edits, with no immutable audit trail.\n\n🍀 High Costs – Current auction fees average ~$80 per session, discouraging participation.\n\n🍀 Slow &amp; Unscalable – Can’t handle high bidder volume with near-zero bid confirmation.\n\n🍀 Limited Adoption – No legally compliant, blockchain-based solution for tangible assets, blocking real-world ADA utility.\n\n\n\n📌 Proposed Solution\n\n🍀 Hydra-Powered Auctions – Use Cardano Layer-2 Hydra for fast finality (&lt;5s), low fees, and scalable on-chain bidding.\n\n🍀 Tokenizing State Assets – Convert real-world assets (cars, apartments, machinery, etc..) into NFTs with verifiable IPFS metadata.\n\n🍀 Hybrid Compliance – Keep KYC, deposits, and legal verification off-chain, ensuring full compliance with national laws.\n\n🍀 Trust &amp; Transparency – All bids are immutable and auditable, eliminating fraud and restoring bidder confidence.\n\n🍀 Global Blueprint – A field-tested, regulation-ready model in Vietnam, easily replicable for other countries, driving real ADA adoption.\n\n\n\n🍀🍀🍀\n\nUnlike typical early-stage proposals, this project is **built on validated, peer\\-reviewed scientific research**.

This project represents exceptional value because it does not fund a \"startup experiment\"; it funds the Web3 integration of an existing, government-authorized business with **50,000\\+ active users**.\n\n\n\nHere is how this cost delivers exponential value to the Cardano ecosystem:\n\n\n\n**1\\. Immediate \"Real Yield\" & ADA Utility**\n\nMost projects promise future utility. We deliver immediate on-chain activity upon launch.\n\n\n\n- Sustained Volume: Unlike one-off dApps, our auction model generates continuous transaction loops: Asset Tokenization (Minting) → Bid Placement (Hydra Transactions) → Settlement (On-Chain Transfer).\n- New Wallet Growth: We are migrating a fraction of our 50,000+ existing non-crypto users  (updated metric) onto Cardano. These are high-net-worth individuals accustomed to buying state assets, bringing fresh capital into the ecosystem beyond typical \"crypto-native\" speculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n**2\\. Strategic \"Alpha\": Proving Hydra for Enterprise**\n\n- The Problem: Hydra is powerful but lacks high-profile, production-grade case studies.\n- The Value: For just 50,000 ADA, the community gets a live, government-regulated proof-of-concept for Hydra. We are proving that Cardano can handle national-scale auctions with <5s finality and near-zero fees. This \"success story\" is a marketing asset worth far more than the project cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n**3\\. The \"Multiplier Effect\" \\(Open Source Blueprint\\)**\n\nWe are not just building for Vietnam; we are building a Global RWA Blueprint.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Zero-Cost Scaling: By open-sourcing our Hydra smart contracts and \"Hybrid Compliance\" workflows , we allow any developer in the Cardano community to replicate this model for real estate or car auctions in their own country without rebuilding from scratch.\n- Academic Credibility: Our inclusion of Scopus-indexed peer-reviewed research (Elsevier/Springer) provides the \"scientific receipt\" that institutional investors demand, elevating Cardano’s brand reputation in the enterprise sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n**4\\. Low Execution Risk**\n\n- Existing Infrastructure: The grant does not pay for business development or basic platform building (which is already done and operational at lacvietauction.vn). The funds are strictly allocated to Cardano/Hydra integration .\n- Proven Team: The team has a track record of handling ~3 successful government auctions per week. We are not figuring out how to run auctions; we are simply moving them on-chain.\n\n\n\n**📌 Summary**: For a total cost of 50,000 ADA, the Cardano ecosystem acquires a functioning RWA bridge, a Hydra scalability showcase, and a peer-reviewed compliance standard—a high-impact package that typically costs 10x more to develop from scratch.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only; excludes retroactive funding, incentives, giveaways, re-granting, or sub-treasuries.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

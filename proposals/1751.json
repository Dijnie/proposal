Unlike existing tools that focus on isolated parts of the development workflow such as smart contract writing, off-chain logic, or frontend integration CS-Code provides an end-to-end development platform that brings all these pieces together in one seamless environment.\n\n\n\nKey Features and Capabilities\n\n\n\n- Synchronized On-Chain & Off-Chain Templates\n    - Developers gain instant access to ready-made templates for on-chain languages like Plutus and Aiken, paired with the corresponding off-chain scaffolding\n    - When a project is scaffolded, the smart contract boilerplate and transaction-building logic are automatically generated together. This ensures consistency, reduces errors, and eliminates the tedious task of manually wiring on-chain and off-chain components.\n\n\n\n- Integrated Testing and Simulation\n    - CS-Code allows developers to simulate smart contract execution and test off-chain transactions in a synchronized environment.\n    - On-chain validation and off-chain transaction logic can be tested together, enabling early detection of errors and saving time that would otherwise be spent debugging across multiple tools.\n- Simplified Deployment Workflows\n    - Developers can deploy their contracts and associated off-chain applications directly to Cardano testnet or mainnet using streamlined workflows.\n    - Complex command-line interactions and configuration steps are abstracted, allowing developers to focus on building functionality rather than infrastructure setup.\n- Full-Stack Scaffolding and Developer Experience\n    - Beyond on-chain and off-chain integration, CS-Code provides frontend scaffolding (React/Next.js templates) with pre-built wallet connections.\n\n\n\nThis allows developers to immediately create interactive dApps without needing to manually wire UI components, backend endpoints, and blockchain interactions.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"- Raising Awareness of Cardano Tools\n    - Many developers, especially newcomers, are unaware of the variety of on-chain and off-chain tools available in the Cardano ecosystem, By integrating these tools into a single, accessible web-based IDE, CS-Code acts as a central discovery hub, helping developers understand and experiment with multiple tools without leaving the platform.\n- Reviving “Silent” Builders and Dormant Projects \n    -  A significant number of Cardano projects stall due to fragmented tooling, lack of templates, or high setup complexity like Marlowe, helios among others - CS-Code lowers the barrier to entry for both existing and new builders by providing ready-to-use scaffolds and integrated workflows, potentially reviving dormant projects and enabling developers to continue previously abandoned ideas.\n- Improving onboarding Developer and educators Productivity\n    - By providing synchronized templates, integrated testing, and one-click deployment, CS-Code reduces repetitive setup work, allowing developers to focus on core innovation rather than plumbing and wiring.\n- Ecosystem Awareness and Adoption\n    - More accessible tooling and live examples increase community engagement, making Cardano more attractive to both developers and investors.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

Accelerated Development Cycles\n\nReduces onboarding friction for developers unfamiliar with Cardano tools (Plutus, Aiken, Mesh SDK, Lucid).\n\nFewer setup errors and integrated testing mean faster iteration cycles for dApps effectively giving a high return on each hour and ADA invested.\n\n\n\n5. Measurable Outcomes\n\nWith quantifiable KPIs such as smart contracts deployed, transactions initiated, unique wallets interacting, and template adoption, the impact per ADA can be tracked and assessed, ensuring accountability and transparency.\n\n\n\n6. Cost Comparison\n\nBuilding the same ecosystem of on-chain, off-chain, and frontend tools separately would likely exceed 150,000–200,000 ADA in cumulative effort and integration costs.\n\n\n\nCS-Code consolidates these efforts into 80,000 ADA, representing a 50–60% saving compared to a fragmented approach, with higher efficiency and end-to-end integration.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only; excludes retroactive funding, incentives, giveaways, re-granting, or sub-treasuries.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

Most engineers in both Web2 and Web3 are trained primarily in imperative programming languages, while Cardano’s core tooling and smart contract development rely heavily on functional paradigms. This mismatch creates a steep learning curve and discourages many capable builders from entering the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Cardano’s development environment depends on several complex tooling layers and dependencies, such as Nix, CHaP, and Cabal, which must be correctly configured before meaningful development can even begin. The setup process is often time-consuming, fragile, and difficult to troubleshoot, especially for those new to the ecosystem. Together, these factors significantly increase the technical and time-related costs of building on Cardano, slowing innovation and limiting ecosystem growth.\n\n\n\nWe plan on providing a solution that allows builders the capacity to build in a well established language (Solidity) directly on the Cardano blockchain. This allows us to greatly simplify the on-boarding process for new builders, allowing for significant new innovation to be brought to the blockchain.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"The MVP will demonstrate that Solidity contracts can be successfully compiled into UPLC and executed on the Cardano blockchain via the Sky Developer Environment.

While there have been attempts at traceability, digital record systems, and blockchain pilots, none have meaningfully solved the structural challenges that Nigerian farmers, aggregators, transporters, and exporters face daily. TrackLite Africa is not just a technological tool, it is a new category of infrastructure that combines trust-building, low-cost verification, mobile-first design, African-centric UX, and Cardano-powered on-chain proofs to create the first mass-adoptable, dispute-proof supply chain system in West Africa.\n\n\n\nBelow is a detailed examination of what makes TrackLite Africa unparalleled.\n\n1. First African Traceability System Built Entirely for Low-Literacy, Low-Connectivity, High-Fraud Environments\n\nMost existing tools assume:\n\nhigh literacy\n\nconstant internet\n\nsmartphone penetration\n\ntechnical comfort\n\nBut our user research across 428 participants shows that these assumptions do not hold for African agricultural supply chains.\n\n\n\nTrackLite Africa introduces innovations designed specifically for African realities:\n\n\n\n✓ Icon-driven UI instead of text-heavy screens\n\n\n\n92% of pilot testers understood workflows without reading English text.\n\n\n\n✓ Offline-first design with automated delayed sync\n\n\n\nBecause 41% of participants operate in intermittent network zones.\n\n\n\n✓ Multi-language: Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, English\n\n\n\nMost Western or NGO tools rarely go beyond English-only.\n\n\n\n✓ Voice-assist prompts for low-literacy users\n\n\n\nA feature validated during prototype testing.\n\n\n\nThis makes TrackLite Africa the first truly accessible, culturally-adapted traceability tool ever built for Nigeria and West Africa.\n\n\n\n2. First System to Convert Every Supply Chain Handover Into a Verifiable, On-Chain \"Proof Event\"\n\n\n\nPrevious tools (NGO pilots, SAP Agri modules, IBM Food Trust, MTN Farmer) document only:\n\n\n\nfinal delivery\n\n\n\nstatic batch information\n\n\n\npayment records\n\n\n\nexport certificates\n\n\n\nNone capture the true accountability gap:\n\nthe movement of goods through informal handovers, where fraud and disputes occur.\n\n\n\n**TrackLite Africa introduces the Proof\\-of\\-Trade Engine, a lightweight mechanism that creates immutable records for:**\n\n\n\nbatch creation\n\n\n\naggregation\n\n\n\ntransport pickup\n\n\n\nmid-route checkpoints\n\n\n\ndelivery\n\n\n\nquality checks\n\n\n\nexport packaging\n\n\n\ndispute documentation\n\n\n\nEvery step becomes a Cardano on-chain metadata event, creating a permanent, fraud-resistant trace from farm to market.\n\n\n\nThis is a world-first for African informal supply chains.\n\n\n\n3. Blockchain as Invisible Infrastructure (No Wallet Setup, No Crypto Exposure, No Complexity)\n\n\n\nMost blockchain solutions in Africa fail because they introduce:\n\n\n\nwallets\n\n\n\ntokens\n\n\n\nprivate keys\n\n\n\ntransaction fees\n\n\n\ncryptographic jargon\n\n\n\nTrackLite Africa eliminates all end-user crypto complexity:\n\n\n\n✓ Users never see a wallet\n\n\n\nThey simply tap “Verify” or “Scan.”\n\n\n\n✓ System subsidizes transaction fees invisibly\n\n\n\nNo tokens, no autoadapters, no risk.\n\n\n\n✓ No stablecoins or regulated assets required\n\n\n\nFully compliant and neutral.\n\n\n\n✓ No blockchain education required to use it\n\n\n\nA critical differentiator validated by our user research.\n\n\n\nFor most users, TrackLite feels like using a simple QR-based receipt system—yet behind the scenes, it becomes the largest agricultural on-chain event generator in Africa.\n\n\n\n4. First African Traceability Tool That Works With Feature Phones via SMS/USSD\n\n\n\nThis solves a massive digital gap ignored by prior solutions.\n\n\n\n11% of farmers in our study still use feature phones, and 76% rely on multiple SIMs due to unstable networks.\n\n\n\nTrackLite Africa’s SMS/USSD fallback enables:\n\n\n\nbatch confirmation\n\n\n\ndelivery validation\n\n\n\ndispute logging\n\n\n\nreceiving notifications\n\n\n\nThis dual-mode design makes TrackLite Africa usable by virtually every segment of the agricultural value chain, regardless of device type.\n\n\n\nNo previous solution combines:\n\n\n\nmobile app\n\n\n\nUSSD fallback\n\n\n\nblockchain infrastructure\n\n\n\nmulti-language voice prompts\n\ninto one unified experience.\n\n\n\n5. A QR Code System Specifically Engineered for High-Fraud Agricultural Markets\n\n\n\nExisting QR systems are built for retail, not logistics.\n\n\n\nTrackLite’s QR innovation is unique because it:\n\n\n\n✓ Encodes both human-readable & machine-readable IDs\n\n\n\nFor rural users who prefer simple visible identifiers.\n\n\n\n✓ Embeds cryptographic signatures off-chain and metadata on-chain\n\n\n\nMeaning QR codes cannot be easily forged.\n\n\n\n✓ Supports multi-scan workflows involving multiple users\n\n\n\n（farmer → transporter → aggregator → processor → exporter）\n\n\n\n✓ Creates tamper-evident, timestamped event chains\n\n\n\nA feature not present in any existing African digital agriculture platforms.\n\n\n\nThis is the first interoperable, fraud-resistant QR handover system tailored for informal agricultural logistics.\n\n\n\n6. The First Scalable System That Does Not Require Farmers to Change Their Current Workflow\n\n\n\nEvery failed pilot in Africa asked farmers to:\n\n\n\nenter detailed data\n\n\n\nlog quantities manually\n\n\n\nfollow rigid workflows\n\n\n\nadopt new weighing or documentation procedures\n\n\n\nThese solutions collapsed because they forced workflow changes.\n\n\n\nTrackLite Africa works differently:\n\n\n\n✔ It adapts to existing workflows\n\n\n\nFarmers simply create a batch by tapping one button.\n\nTransporters simply scan a QR.\n\nReceivers simply confirm delivery.\n\n\n\n✔ It captures the workflow as-is\n\n\n\nNot as it “should be,” but as it exists in Africa.\n\n\n\n✔ It adds value without increasing workload\n\n\n\nWhich is why 87% of interviewed participants would adopt immediately.\n\n\n\nThis makes TrackLite Africa the first “friction-neutral” blockchain traceability solution designed for low-structure supply chains.\n\n\n\n7. Export-Grade Traceability Without the Cost of Enterprise Software\n\n\n\nEnterprise tools like SAP Agri and IBM Food Trust require:\n\n\n\nexpensive licensing\n\n\n\ndeep training\n\n\n\nconstant internet\n\n\n\nlarge teams\n\n\n\nstructured supply chains\n\n\n\nTrackLite Africa delivers equivalent export documentation through:\n\n\n\nautomated PDF trace reports\n\n\n\nGPS-tagged events\n\n\n\ntimestamped workflows\n\n\n\nquality assessment logs\n\n\n\nstandardized batch signatures\n\n\n\nAt less than 1% of the cost.\n\n\n\nThis makes premium market access possible for SMEs and cooperatives who were previously excluded.\n\n\n\n8. The First African Traceability Tool Designed to Generate Large-Scale On-Chain ESG Data\n\n\n\nMost traceability systems do not integrate sustainability metrics.\n\n\n\nTrackLite Africa enables:\n\n\n\nwaste reduction documentation\n\n\n\ncarbon footprint reduction reporting\n\n\n\nloss prevention measurements\n\n\n\nsupply chain transparency for climate funds\n\n\n\nThis creates:\n\n\n\nverifiable carbon credit datasets\n\n\n\neligibility for climate-smart subsidies\n\n\n\nmeasurable ESG impact\n\n\n\nFor the first time ever, Cardano becomes the infrastructure layer for agricultural climate reporting in Africa.\n\n\n\n9. A Fully Replicable Playbook for 12M Nigerian Farmers & 40M+ Across West Africa\n\n\n\nTrackLite Africa is built with scalability as a core principle:\n\n\n\nlow-cost\n\n\n\nlow-tech\n\n\n\nlow-barrier\n\n\n\nmulti-language\n\n\n\nblockchain-native\n\n\n\ncooperative-driven\n\n\n\nThis creates a continent-wide expansion pathway:\n\n\n\nNigeria (primary)\n\n\n\nGhana\n\n\n\nKenya\n\n\n\nIvory Coast\n\n\n\nSenegal\n\n\n\nTanzania\n\n\n\nThe architecture supports rapid replication, something no previous pilot was designed for.\n\n\n\n10. First Unified Framework Combining Agricultural Traceability + Transport Verification + Export Documentation\n\n\n\nMost tools handle only one part of the chain:\n\n\n\nfarm tools\n\n\n\nlogistics tools\n\n\n\nexport compliance tools\n\n\n\npayment apps\n\n\n\nTrackLite Africa uniquely combines all three:\n\n\n\n1. Pre-transport (batch creation)\n\n2. Transport verification (handover + checkpoints)\n\n3. Export documentation (premium markets)\n\n\n\nThis holistic system solves end-to-end fraud and documentation problems for the first time.\n\n\n\nConclusion: The Innovation Advantage\n\n\n\nTrackLite Africa is innovative because it solves a decades-old African supply chain crisis using the right mix of technology, behavioral insight, and blockchain infrastructure. It does not repeat the mistakes of previous tools. It does not impose blockchain complexity. It does not require workflow changes. It does not target only elite or tech-savvy users.\n\n\n\nInstead, it:\n\n\n\nfits African realities\n\n\n\nleverages Cardano invisibly\n\n\n\nbuilds trust\n\n\n\nscales organically\n\n\n\nreduces fraud\n\n\n\nimproves farmer income\n\n\n\nstrengthens trade reliability\n\n\n\nand establishes Cardano as Africa’s economic verification layer\n\n\n\nTrackLite Africa is not just “another traceability project.”\n\nIt is a systemic innovation that has never existed in this form before, uniquely capable of onboarding thousands of users and generating hundreds of thousands of real-world Cardano transactions annually.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"The TrackLite Africa prototype (MVP) demonstrates the complete functional flow of our supply chain verification system exactly as users will experience it during real agricultural operations.

This solution directly addresses the root causes of supply chain losses, disputes, fraud, unverifiable handovers, documentation failures, and export rejection, by transforming every stage of the farm-to-market journey into a verifiable, tamper-proof on-chain proof event recorded on Cardano.\n\nThe system is intentionally designed to be lightweight, QR-based, offline-friendly, and completely abstracted from crypto complexity. Users never interact with blockchain, they simply scan, confirm, and verify. The blockchain operates invisibly as a trust engine, ensuring that smallholder farmers, transporters, aggregators, and exporters gain the same level of accountability that major global supply chains enjoy.\n\nThe solution is built around five interconnected pillars, each directly mapped to the verified pain points identified in the User Research Report:\n\n**1\\. A Unified, Verifiable Record of Every Supply Chain Event**\n\nThe core of TrackLite Africa’s solution is a digital, QR-based workflow that captures all major supply chain events as immutable on-chain proofs.\n\nThese include:\n\n1.\tBatch creation at the farm or warehouse\n\n2.\tHandover from farmer to aggregator\n\n3.\tHandover from aggregator to transporter\n\n4.\tArrival at local storage center\n\n5.\tDispatch for distribution\n\n6.\tDelivery at destination\n\n7.\tExport preparation and certification\n\n8.\tDispute documentation\n\n9.\tQuality verification\n\n10.\tInventory reconciliation\n\nEvery one of these events becomes:\n\n•\ta timestamped record\n\n•\ta verifiable proof\n\n•\ta structured metadata object\n\n•\ta dispute-resolving evidence pack\n\n•\ta digital trail that can be trusted by buyers, exporters, and regulators\n\nBy converting undocumented, unverifiable physical interactions into mathematically provable records, TrackLite eliminates the ambiguity that allows losses, fraud, manipulation, and relationship breakdowns to flourish.\n\nThis directly solves the “handover black hole,” where 92% of farmers lose visibility after goods leave their hands.\n\n**2\\. Simple QR\\-Based Workflow That Anyone Can Use**\n\nAfrican agricultural markets require tools that are:\n\n•\textremely simple\n\n•\textremely fast\n\n•\textremely low-cost\n\n•\tcompatible with low digital literacy\n\n•\tfunctional in areas with poor connectivity\n\nTrackLite addresses these requirements with a three-step QR workflow\n\n1.\tScan the batch QR code\n\n2.\tVerify quantity/condition\n\n3.\tConfirm handover or delivery\n\nThis process takes under 6 seconds and works even on basic Android phones.\n\nThe QR workflow solves multiple research-identified pain points\n\n•\tensures both parties confirm the transaction\n\n•\tprovides objective evidence for disputes\n\n•\tties every stage into a sequential proof chain\n\n•\tuses universally understood interaction patterns\n\nTrackLite intentionally removes the need for typing, forms, or complex navigation, making it accessible to low-literacy and low-tech users.\n\n\n\n\n\n**3\\. Offline\\-First Architecture for Rural Connectivity Challenges**\n\nAfrican farming regions suffer from:\n\n•\tinconsistent mobile data\n\n•\tintermittent network coverag\n\n•\thigh data costs\n\n•\tslow 3G/4G connections\n\n\n\nTrackLite is built with offline-first architecture, enabling:\n\n•\tQR scanning without internet\n\n•\tlocal device storage\n\n•\tdelayed synchronization\n\n•\tSMS fallback for extremely remote users\n\n\n\nThis design was validated during field tests in Kano, Kaduna, Oyo, and Ogun where 41% of users operate with unreliable connections.\n\nThe solution ensures supply chain verification is never interrupted by network issues, addressing one of the biggest failures of past digital traceability pilots.\n\n\n\n**4\\. Blockchain as Invisible Infrastructure, No Crypto Required**\n\nTrackLite uses Cardano not as a finance tool but as a trust engine.\n\nUsers never see:\n\n•\twallets\n\n•\tprivate keys\n\n•\ttokens\n\n•\tgas fees\n\n•\tseed phrases\n\n\n\nInstead, the platform abstracts all blockchain interactions through:\n\n1.\tDelegated signing mechanisms\n\n2.\tMetadata submissions\n\n3.\tLightweight backend relayers\n\n4.\tCustodial identity management for low-tech users\n\n\n\nThis approach solves a major adoption barrier revealed in research:\n\n•\t64% of participants fear complex technology\n\n•\t58% fear hidden costs\n\n•\t47% distrust unfamiliar digital systems\n\n\n\nBy hiding blockchain complexity, TrackLite ensures that the solution’s value is experienced, not studied. Users interact with a simple mobile workflow while the blockchain guarantees integrity behind the scenes.\n\nThis removes the need for cryptocurrency knowledge entirely, allowing mass adoption without regulatory risk.\n\n\n\n**5\\. Export\\-Grade Documentation and Dispute Resolution Tools**\n\nTwo of the most financially damaging issues identified were:\n\n•\texport rejection due to missing documentation\n\n•\tdomestic disputes due to unverifiable handover events\n\n\n\nTrackLite introduces digital, verifiable, on-chain provenance reports that:\n\n1.\tcompile QR-scan event histories\n\n2.\tinclude timestamps, GPS markers, and photos\n\n3.\tgenerate export documentation\n\n4.\tprovide immutable evidence bundles\n\n\n\nThis solves:\n\n1.\tThe 30% premium loss experienced by exporters\n\n2.\tThe 20–35% revenue reduction caused by documentation failures\n\n3.\tThe dispute impossible problem, where poorer stakeholders always lose because they lack proof\n\n\n\nExport buyers, certification agencies, and regulators can verify authenticity instantly by scanning a QR code linked to the product’s on-chain record.\n\nThis elevates African agricultural products into compliance with global traceability standards, allowing exporters to access previously unavailable premium markets.\n\n\n\n**HOW THE SOLUTION ADDRESSES EACH CORE PROBLEM**\n\nTrackLite directly responds to each documented supply chain failure.\n\nProblem 1: Disputes due to unverifiable quantities and conditions\n\nSolution: QR-scanned handover events recorded on-chain provide tamper-proof evidence.\n\nProblem 2: Payment delays due to lack of delivery confirmation\n\nSolution: Timestamped delivery proofs trigger quicker payment authorization.\n\nProblem 3: Export rejections due to documentation gaps\n\nSolution: Auto-generated export-ready, blockchain-verified traceability reports.\n\nProblem 4: Trust breakdown between farmers, transporters &amp; aggregators\n\nSolution: Transparent event chains eliminate distrust and finger-pointing.\n\nProblem 5: Entire supply chain visibility lost after goods leave the farm\n\nSolution: Real-time, sequential event tracking restores end-to-end oversight.\n\nProblem 6: Lack of digital literacy prevents adoption of existing solutions\n\nSolution: QR-based UI + voice prompts + multilingual support ensures accessibility.\n\nProblem 7: Rural connectivity limits digital solutions\n\nSolution: Offline-first architecture + SMS fallback ensures universal usability.\n\n\n\n**WHY THE SOLUTION IS UNIQUELY SUITED TO AFRICA**\n\nExisting solutions in Nigeria and West Africa fail because they:\n\n•\trequire expensive enterprise software\n\n•\tdemand reliable internet\n\n•\trely on tokens or financial incentives\n\n•\thave poor UX for low-tech users\n\n•\tare designed for Western supply chains\n\n\n\nTrackLite is designed specifically for African conditions:\n\n1.\tWorks on $50 Android phones\n\n2.\tWorks with unstable internet\n\n3.\tRequires almost zero literacy\n\n4.\tSupports multiple languages\n\n5.\tRequires zero crypto knowledge\n\n6.\tFits informal and semi-formal trade structures\n\nIt meets farmers and traders exactly where they are.\n\n\n\n**HOW TRACKLITE LEVERAGES CARDANO TO DELIVER REAL\\-WORLD UTILITY**\n\nCardano provides:\n\n•\tlow-cost on-chain metadata\n\n•\tscalable throughput\n\n•\tpredictable fees\n\n•\topen-source tooling\n\n•\tESG-ready verification frameworks\n\n\n\nTrackLite converts real agricultural movement into:\n\n•\tverifiable Cardano transactions\n\n•\tvaluable supply chain data\n\n•\trepeatable business adoption\n\n•\thigh-volume utility-driven activity\n\n\n\nThis creates:\n\n•\tsustained on-chain activity\n\n•\treal-world use cases\n\n•\ttransaction-driven network effects\n\n•\ta new pipeline for future RealFi applications\n\n\n\nTHE END RESULT: A TRANSPARENT, TRUSTED, EFFICIENT SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nBy digitizing and verifying every stage of the supply chain, TrackLite Africa:\n\n•\treduces losses\n\n•\taccelerates payments\n\n•\tincreases income\n\n•\topens export markets\n\n•\timproves accountability\n\n•\teliminates fraudulent practices\n\n•\tstrengthens trading relationships\n\n•\tprovides data for financial inclusion\n\n•\tgenerates massive, verifiable on-chain activity\n\nTrackLite becomes the trust infrastructure underpinning African agricultural commerce, powered by Cardano.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"TrackLite Africa represents one of the most consequential real-world adoption opportunities for the Cardano ecosystem to date.

This is significant because:\n\n•\tEvery handover verification\n\n•\tEvery delivery confirmation\n\n•\tEvery export preparation\n\n•\tEvery dispute evidence generation\n\n…creates a real, meaningful Cardano transaction that validates human economic interaction.\n\nThis demonstrates Cardano’s capability to support essential, high-volume supply chain workflows, proving scalability beyond DeFi.\n\nThis kind of sustained utility strengthens:\n\n•\tCardano’s transaction diversity\n\n•\tresilience against market volatility\n\n•\tadoption narratives for global supply chains\n\n•\ttechnical credibility for enterprise partnerships\n\n•\tthe long-term sustainability of network activity\n\nRealFi becomes real.\n\n**3\\. NEW DATA LAYERS THAT SUPPORT FUTURE DAPP INNOVATION**\n\nTrackLite creates a stream of structured, high-quality metadata about:\n\n•\tproduct movement\n\n•\tlogistics timing\n\n•\tsupply chain reliability\n\n•\tagricultural patterns\n\n•\tdispute frequency\n\n•\tbuyer behavior\n\n•\tcooperative activity levels\n\nThis information is invaluable for:\n\n•\tdevelopers building future RealFi applications\n\n•\trisk assessment tools\n\n•\tdecentralized insurance\n\n•\tmicro-lending and credit scoring\n\n•\tmarket prediction models\n\n•\tsustainability analytics\n\nIt positions Cardano as a foundational layer for data-driven dApps, particularly in emerging markets.\n\nThe presence of verifiable, timestamped supply chain records unlocks entirely new categories of decentralized applications.\n\n**4\\. ACCELERATION OF CARDANO’S REALFI MISSION**\n\nCardano’s long-stated value proposition is enabling real-world financial systems for underserved populations.\n\nTrackLite operationalizes this vision by:\n\n•\tenabling formal records for previously undocumented farmers\n\n•\tproving eligibility for finance, insurance, and credit\n\n•\tbuilding trust-based profiles for each participant\n\n•\tcreating digital CVs for supply chain actors\n\n•\testablishing integrity benchmarks\n\nThis positions Cardano as the blockchain of record for:\n\n•\tagricultural finance providers\n\n•\tcooperative-based savings schemes\n\n•\timpact funders\n\n•\tmicrocredit organizations\n\n•\tcarbon credit verifiers\n\n•\tinternational development agencies\n\nThe result is a tangible, measurable elevation of Cardano’s global RealFi leadership.\n\n**5\\. SUPPORTING ESG &amp; SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES**\n\nAgriculture accounts for over 40% of Africa’s workforce, but almost none of their economic activities are digitally captured.\n\nBy generating on-chain evidence of:\n\n•\treduced food waste\n\n•\timproved product visibility\n\n•\tsustainable trade practices\n\n•\tenvironmentally responsible handovers\n\nTrackLite produces verifiable ESG metrics.\n\nThis creates opportunities for Cardano in:\n\n•\tcarbon credit markets\n\n•\tregenerative agriculture tracking\n\n•\tclimate finance\n\n•\tsustainability reporting\n\nOrganizations like WFP, FAO, AfDB, and IFAD rely on verifiable accountability data, TrackLite provides exactly that, on Cardano.\n\n**6\\. A BLUEPRINT FOR EMERGING MARKET ONBOARDING**\n\nTrackLite is not just a product,it is a replicable adoption framework.\n\nIt establishes a standardized approach for:\n\n1. Low-literacy onboarding\n2. Offline-first dApp interaction\n3. QR-based blockchain verification\n4. Field-agent assisted user training\n5. Cooperative partnership methods\n6. Scalable support infrastructures\n7. Supply-chain focused metadata standards\n\nThis framework can be replicated to other sectors including:\n\n•\tfisheries\n\n•\tlivestock\n\n•\tmining\n\n•\tmanufacturing\n\n•\tintracity logistics\n\nBy open-sourcing all components, TrackLite becomes a reference for future Catalyst proposers and Cardano ecosystem builders.\n\n**8\\. EMPOWERING CARDANO DEVELOPERS**\n\nThe project delivers:\n\n•\topen-source mobile client\n\n•\topen-source backend\n\n•\topen-source smart contracts\n\n•\topen-source identity integration modules\n\n•\topen-source SDK extensions for Mesh\n\n•\topen-source documentation\n\n•\ton-chain dataset examples\n\n•\tUI/UX patterns for low-literacy markets\n\nThese assets become powerful learning materials for\n\n•\tstudents\n\n•\tnew developers\n\n•\thackathons\n\n•\tCardano hubs\n\n•\tCatalyst-funded teams\n\nTrackLite essentially becomes a modular learning playground for African builders wanting to develop impact-based dApps.\n\n**9\\. NEW PARTNERSHIP GATEWAYS FOR CARDANO**\n\nThe agricultural supply chain ecosystem includes:\n\n•\tlocal cooperatives\n\n•\tstate agricultural boards\n\n•\tfederal ministry of agriculture\n\n•\tfood exporters\n\n•\tlogistics unions\n\n•\tcertification bodies\n\n•\tcommodity associations\n\nTrackLite introduces Cardano to all of these stakeholders.\n\nThis opens doors for:\n\n•\tenterprise integrations\n\n•\tregional government collaborations\n\n•\tpan-African supply chain digitalization\n\n•\tacademy and institution partnerships\n\nThe presence of a functional, measurable solution automates the conversation:\n\n“It works. It is real. Here is the data.”\n\nThis strengthens Cardano’s credibility within policy and enterprise circles.\n\n**10\\. SOCIAL IMPACT ALIGNED WITH CARDANO’S VALUES**\n\nThe Cardano ecosystem emphasizes:\n\n•\tfairness\n\n•\tdecentralization\n\n•\tempowerment\n\n•\ttransparency\n\n•\treal-world benefit\n\nTrackLite embodies these values by:\n\n•\tprotecting farmers from exploitation\n\n•\tenabling accountability regardless of wealth\n\n•\tstrengthening cooperation across ethnic lines\n\n•\tsupporting low-income communities with high-tech tools\n\n•\tenabling transparent trade without favoritism\n\nThis demonstrates blockchain’s moral utility, not just its financial utility.\n\n\n\n**11\\. LONG\\-TERM NETWORK EFFECTS FOR CARDANO**\n\nOnce one farmer starts using TrackLite, three more stakeholders are forced into the ecosystem:\n\n→ the transporter\n\n→ the aggregator\n\n→ the buyer/exporter\n\nEvery verified handover creates a chain reaction that expands Cardano’s presence deeper into the supply chain.\n\nNetwork effects create:\n\n•\tadoption loops\n\n•\ttransaction loops\n\n•\tpartner loops\n\n•\teducation loops\n\n•\texpansion loops\n\n\n\nIn 3 years, TrackLite can generate:\n\n•\t2.5M+ annual proof events\n\n•\t75,000+ active users\n\n•\t20,000+ cooperative members\n\n•\t100+ institutional partners\n\n\n\n\n\n**CONCLUSION: WHY TRACKLITE IS A CATALYST ECOSYSTEM MULTIPLIER**\n\nTrackLite Africa creates unprecedented positive impact for the Cardano community by:\n\n•\tonboarding completely new user populations\n\n•\tgenerating massive real-world transaction volume\n\n•\tproviding open-source tools for developers\n\n•\tenabling new RealFi applications\n\n•\tsupporting sustainability and ESG narratives\n\n•\tcreating a replicable model for future expansions\n\n•\tstrengthening Cardano’s brand as an adoption-ready blockchain\n\n•\treducing reliance on speculative usage\n\nIt transforms Cardano from a blockchain people invest in into a blockchain people depend on to safeguard their livelihoods.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability? How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?","description":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability? How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?","format":null,"answer":"TrackLite Africa is designed and led by a multidisciplinary team with a strong record of execution across blockchain development, agricultural systems, user onboarding, community programs, product design, and research. The team possesses a combined 35+ years of experience across technology, governance, supply chains, and field deployment in Africa. This section explains why the TrackLite Africa team is uniquely capable of delivering the project at a high level of trust, accountability, and technical rigor and outlines the systems we have established to guarantee feasibility throughout development, deployment, and scale.\n\n1. Proven Technical Capability and Blockchain Expertise\n\nTrackLite Africa has a technically competent team with direct experience in Cardano, decentralized identity, and mobile development for low-resource environments:\n\nTechnical Architect (Hadiza Mohammed) brings experience in distributed systems, smart contracts, and Cardano developer tooling (Mesh SDK, Ogmios, tx-building). She previously led integration work on identity-driven verification pipelines, making her perfectly suited for metadata-based traceability.\n\nBlockchain Developer (Umar Fahm) specializes in Cardano metadata schemas, chain-sync indexing, and high-volume transaction batching, precisely the architecture TrackLite requires to scale to 500,000+ annual proof events while keeping costs extremely low.\n\nMobile App Developer (Adeyemi Samuel) is experienced in building offline-capable Android applications optimized for rural Africa, low-bandwidth environments, and low-spec phones. His expertise ensures TrackLite will function even where internet access is intermittent.\n\nTogether, this technical foundation ensures that TrackLite is not conceptual, it is engineered for real deployment\n\n\n\n2. Demonstrated Past Work and Pre-Development Proof\n\nTo comply with the Fund 15 requirement that proposals be past the “idea stage,” we have produced a robust evidence package, accessible through our public TrackLite Evidence Repository:\n\n•\tComprehensive 5-chapter User Research Report (428 participants, 6 states, verified data)\n\n•\tHigh-fidelity UI/UX prototypes in Figma\n\n•\tTechnical architecture diagrams including:\n\n•\tOn-chain metadata architecture\n\n•\tQR identity lifecycle\n\n•\tOffline sync model\n\n•\tChain indexer flow\n\n•\tConcept Note &amp; Whitepaper (covering economic rationale, data flow, scalability models)\n\n•\tPoC Video Walkthrough demonstrating batch creation → QR generation → scan → confirmation\n\nThis level of pre-development work demonstrates credibility, reduces risk, and shows that the solution is already validated, not theoretical.\n\n\n\n3. Strong Governance, Documentation &amp; Transparency Culture\n\nTrackLite Africa has a governance-first leadership approach anchored by the Project Lead, Lazarus Christian Chinaza, a member of Intersect (Cardano’s governance body), with experience in:\n\n•\ttreasury accountability\n\n•\tmilestone-based reporting\n\n•\tdeliverable quality assurance\n\n•\tcommunity-driven oversight\n\n•\tdocumentation for decentralized ecosystems\n\nGovernance frameworks already prepared:\n\n•\tInternal Milestone Review Protocol\n\n•\tTransparent budget tracking template\n\n•\tWeekly Technical Review Meeting structure\n\n•\tCommunity reporting via Catalyst channels\n\n•\tField agent verification logs\n\n•\tData privacy compliance checklist\n\nThis ensures the project will meet all Catalyst reporting and accountability standards\n\n\n\n4. Operational Capability to Deploy Across Nigeria\n\nTrackLite Africa is not relying on theory our team includes specialists with deep experience in agricultural operations, rural logistics, and field deployment:\n\nField Deployment Lead (Grace Okon) has worked extensively with cooperatives, farmer associations, and informal supply chains, giving her the capacity to coordinate field agents and ensure adoption.\n\nField Agent Network (6–10 regional staff) is distributed across Nigeria’s major agricultural zones, ensuring that onboarding, training, and support do not bottleneck at any point.\n\nMonitoring &amp; Evaluation Lead (Egemonye Marvellous) provides structured measurement of on-chain metrics, economic impact, and retention curves.\n\nThis hybrid model (technical + operational) ensures feasibility at scale\n\n\n\n5. Clear Milestone Structure With Measurable Deliverables\n\nOur milestone plan is structured to guarantee accountability and allow reviewers to easily monitor progress. Each milestone outputs:\n\n•\tcode releases\n\n•\tUI/UX artifacts\n\n•\tuser onboarding logs\n\n•\ton-chain activity\n\n•\tvideo demonstrations\n\n•\tanalytical reports\n\nFunding is tied to achievement of verifiable deliverables not narrative descriptions.\n\nThis alignment ensures financial responsibility and practical execution\n\n\n\n6. Feasibility Validation from Extensive User Research\n\nThe 428-participant research study across 6 states provides deep validation for feasibility:\n\n•\t89% smartphone ownership\n\n•\t82% QR code familiarity\n\n•\t87% immediate adoption willingness\n\n•\t91% comprehension of prototype workflows\n\n•\t76% demand for offline-first design\n\n•\t88% of exporters urgently need traceability solutions\n\nThe product–market fit is extremely strong.\n\nThe workflows are validated, understood, and demanded by real users.\n\nThis reduces the risk of adoption failure and demonstrates real feasibility\n\n\n\n7. Risk Mitigation Measures\n\nWe have identified core risks and built mitigation strategies:\n\nConnectivity risk:\n\n→ Offline-first architecture with SMS fallback.\n\nAdoption risk:\n\n→ Cooperative-based onboarding; field agents deploy training physically.\n\nComplexity risk:\n\n→ UI/UX designed for low-literacy environments; heavy use of icons and voice prompts.\n\nScalability risk:\n\n→ Metadata-only transactions ensure low fees and high throughput.\n\nSecurity risk:\n\n→ Third-party audit of smart contract logic.\n\nSustainability risk:\n\n→ Freemium model ensures long-term platform self-sufficiency.\n\nThese measures ensure long-term viability beyond funding\n\n\n\n8. Data Transparency & On-Chain Verifiability\n\nAll major performance indicators are on-chain and publicly verifiable:\n\n•\tnumber of proof events\n\n•\tmetadata volume\n\n•\tverified handovers\n\n•\tdelivery confirmations\n\n•\tadoption progression\n\nThis ensures that TrackLite cannot inflate numbers or “paper” adoption.\n\nEvery claim is backed by blockchain evidence.\n\nFor Catalyst reviewers, this creates trust in both reporting and long-term impact.\n\n\n\n9. Open-Source Commitment Ensures Auditability\n\nTrackLite Africa is fully open-source under MIT License.\n\nThis enables\n\n•\tthird-party audits\n\n•\tcommunity contribution\n\n•\ttechnical transparency\n\n•\tfuture replication across Africa\n\n\n\nFull documentation will be publicly accessible, including:\n\n•\tmobile app code\n\n•\tbackend code\n\n•\tsmart contract scripts\n\n•\tAPI documentation\n\n•\tarchitecture diagrams\n\n•\tuser onboarding scripts\n\nThis assures trust, accountability, and ecosystem value.\n\n\n\n10. Long-Term Feasibility &amp; Sustainability\n\nTrackLite Africa is designed to survive beyond Catalyst funding:\n\n•\tfreemium revenue model\n\n•\tdemand-driven enterprise API services\n\n•\tpremium export documentation features\n\n•\tgovernment &amp;amp; NGO partnerships\n\nBy Month 18, TrackLite is projected to reach financial breakeven based on conservative adoption models. This ensures Catalyst’s investment produces lasting, real-world impact.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nTrackLite Africa is backed by a fully capable team, validated by extensive field research, strengthened by a governance-oriented leadership culture, engineered with realistic technical architecture, and structured through clear, auditable milestones. Every element of the project—from UX workflows to on-chain design, has been tested with real users and evaluated for operational feasibility. The result is a high-trust, low-risk, deliverable-ready project that will generate measurable economic and on-chain impact for the Cardano ecosystem.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Milestones","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Project Milestones","description":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":null,"title":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","description":"The number of milestones required depends on the amount of funding requested.

The cost-to-impact ratio across every dimension, technical output, user adoption, transaction volume, sustainability, scalability, and ecosystem expansion demonstrates an unusually high return on treasury funds, positioning this project as one of the most cost-efficient, utility-driven proposals in Fund15.\n\nThe central argument for value is this: ₳165,800 produces a minimum of 500,000 real on-chain events per year, thousands of new Cardano users, a fully functional MVP + backend infrastructure, and a replicable model capable of reaching millions of farmers across West Africa. This means Cardano’s treasury is effectively paying ₳0.33 per on-chain event in year one, and the cost drops even further in subsequent years when the platform continues to operate without additional Catalyst funding.\n\n1. Showcase of Extreme Cost Efficiency\n\nMost blockchain supply chain systems require:\n\n•\tenterprise-level infrastructure,\n\n•\tspecialized hardware,\n\n•\thigh development costs,\n\n•\trecurring subscriptions,\n\n•\tor involve token-based complexity.\n\nTrackLite achieves the same end goal—verifiable, real-time traceability—with a lean budget, because:\n\n•\tIt uses Cardano metadata instead of expensive L1 execution.\n\n•\tIt uses QR-based workflows that require no hardware investment.\n\n•\tIt develops once and deploys repeatedly with negligible per-user cost.\n\n•\tIt leverages existing farmer networks, lowering marketing expenses.\n\n•\tIt relies on efficient field agents rather than expensive institutional intermediaries.\n\nThe treasury essentially funds the creation of a reusable infrastructure asset: a lightweight, scalable verification engine that can support tens of thousands of events without proportional increases in cost.\n\nIn comparison, commercial supply chain software in Africa costs:\n\n•\t$600–$2,400 per business per year for basic licenses,\n\n•\t$3–$7 per transaction for verified trace events,\n\n•\t$15,000–$30,000 for white-label setup.\n\nTrackLite delivers the same functional value at a fraction of the cost, amplified by decentralization, transparency, and Cardano’s low fees\n\n\n\n2. The Treasury Receives Real, Measurable, On-Chain Utility\n\nMany ecosystem proposals struggle to demonstrate verifiable outputs. TrackLite solves this by connecting funding directly to measurable blockchain activity. Every milestone notes a target number of transactions, creating hard, on-chain evidence of value delivery. These events include\n\n•\tbatch creation,\n\n•\thandover verification,\n\n•\tdelivery confirmation,\n\n•\tquality assessments,\n\n•\texport documentation proofs.\n\nThis means Catalyst receives:\n\n•\tauditable, traceable, immutable evidence of project impact,\n\n•\topen analytics dashboards,\n\n•\tchain-linked status updates, and\n\n•\tautomatic proof-of-work outputs, rather than trust-based reporting.\n\nThe treasury is not funding marketing materials, generic awareness programs, or theoretical infrastructure, it is funding measurable transactions representing real economic events across Nigeria’s agricultural corridors\n\n\n\n3. Strong Link Between Treasury Spending and Economic Value Creation\n\nNigeria loses an estimated ₦3.5 trillion ($3.2 billion) annually to post-harvest losses and supply chain documentation failures. TrackLite directly addresses this inefficiency. During the pilot alone:\n\n•\tfarmers preserve an estimated $1.2M+ in economic value,\n\n•\texporters reduce rejection rates (20–35% savings),\n\n•\taggregators reduce shrinkage and payment disputes,\n\n•\ttransporters eliminate false theft accusations.\n\nThis means the Catalyst treasury’s ₳165,800 produces 7x–10x equivalent real-world economic benefits within 11 months. This level of economic leverage is rarely achieved at this budget ti2\n\n\n\n4. Sustainable Impact Beyond the Funding Period\n\nUnlike many projects that require continuous budget extensions, TrackLite is designed for revenue generation and long-term operation without additional Catalyst funding.\n\nThe freemium model in Year 2 yields\n\n•\t₦18–₦35 million monthly revenue,\n\n•\twith profitability by Month 16,\n\n•\tand break-even by Month 12.\n\nThis sustainability ensures the treasury’s investment continues to deliver\n\n•\ttransactions,\n\n•\tadoption,\n\n•\tand ecosystem integration\n\nfor years beyond the project term, without future treasury burden.\n\nTreasury ROI increases every year as:\n\n•\tmore events are generated,\n\n•\tmore farmers onboard,\n\n•\tmore cooperatives adopt the tool\n\n•\tand more supply chain actors integrate TrackLite into daily operations.\n\n\n\n5. Expansion Capability: One Proposal, Multi-Country Potential\n\nBecause TrackLite is designed for fragmented supply chains common across West Africa, it can be expanded into:\n\n•\tGhana,\n\n•\tIvory Coast,\n\n•\tSenegal,\n\n•\tKenya,\n\n•\tRwanda,\n\n•\tTanzania,\n\nwithout major architectural changes.\n\nThis means one funded MVP unlocks a multi-country adoption pathway, multiplying Cardano’s reach far beyond the Nigerian pilot\n\n\n\n6. A Low-Risk Investment with Milestone-Based Delivery\n\nCatalyst funds are protected via\n\n•\tfour tightly defined milestones,\n\n•\ttransaction-based acceptance criteria,\n\n•\ttransparent open-source code delivery,\n\n•\tmonthly reporting,\n\n•\ton-chain analytics dashboards,\n\n•\tand independently verifiable adoption data.\n\nTreasury exposure at any time is fractionally tied to progress, reducing financial risk.\n\n\n\n7. High-Value Open Source Assets for the Developer Community\n\nTrackLite’s MIT-licensed output becomes a reusable toolkit for\n\n•\tfuture dApps,\n\n•\tagricultural projects,\n\n•\tdigital identity projects,\n\n•\tlogistics frameworks,\n\n•\tand social impact initiatives.\n\nThis amplifies the long-term value of each ADA spent because developers can fork, copy, and integrate TrackLite components without cost. The treasury effectively invests in shared digital infrastructure rather than single-use code.\n\n\n\n8. Best-in-Class Value for Fund 15 Use Case Category\n\nWhen benchmarked against\n\n•\tthe complexity of the build,\n\n•\tthe scale of expected adoption,\n\n•\tthe strength of the business model,\n\n•\tand the projected on-chain activity,\n\nTrackLite delivers the highest measurable utility per ADA among comparable proposals in this funding tier.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ₳165,800 requested delivers disproportionately high ecosystem value across adoption, transaction volume, sustainability, open-source contribution, real-world economic impact, and future scalability. It transforms treasury funds into a permanent infrastructural asset delivering hundreds of thousands of real, auditable, economically meaningful transactions on Cardano.\n\nThis project represents an exceptionally high-value investment, delivering one of the strongest Money Value cases in Fund15.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only; excludes retroactive funding, incentives, giveaways, re-granting, or sub-treasuries.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

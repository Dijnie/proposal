## Value for Money Analysis

### Cost Per Expected Outcome

**Assumption: Enable 150 projects in first year**

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Cost per project enabled | ₳120,000 ÷ 150 projects | ₳800/project |
| Cost per project (USD) | $54,000 ÷ 150 projects | $360/project |
| Cost per month of development | ₳120,000 ÷ 8 months | ₳15,000/month |
| Cost per team member per month | ₳120,000 ÷ 5 ÷ 8 | ₳3,000/person/month |

### Cost Comparison with Alternatives

| Approach | Cost | Timeline | Outcome |
|----------|------|----------|---------|
| **Custom Plutus Development** | $100,000+ | 6-12 months | Single project |
| **Existing Tools (Limited)** | $0-5,000 | Weeks | Limited functionality |
| **Proteus (This Proposal)** | $54,000 | 8 months | **Platform enabling 150+ projects** |

### Return on Investment for Cardano Ecosystem

- **Development Cost Savings:** Each project saves $50,000+ by using Proteus instead of custom development
- **Transaction Volume:** Dynamic NFTs generate 10-100x more transactions than static NFTs
- **Network Effects:** More projects → more developers → more adoption
- **Market Capture:** Enables Cardano to compete in $16.34B gaming and $39.8-85.35B ticketing markets

## Budget Justification

### Why ₳120,000 is Appropriate

1. **Full Open Source Commitment:** All code (smart contracts, backend, frontend, templates) released under MIT License - maximum ecosystem benefit
2. **Production-Ready Platform:** Not R&D - building production infrastructure with SLA guarantees
3. **Comprehensive Scope:** 4-layer architecture (contracts, workers, API, dashboard) with automation, templates, and documentation
4. **Proven Team:** HTlabs delivered Fund 10, 11, 12, 13 projects successfully - low execution risk
5. **Ecosystem Multiplier:** ₳120,000 investment enables 150+ projects, each saving $50,000+ in development costs
6. **Sustainable Impact:** Open source platform creates permanent infrastructure benefit for Cardano

### Budget Efficiency Indicators

- **Team Compensation:** ₳1,800/month ($810) is 85% below market rate for blockchain developers
- **Infrastructure:** 15% allocation is industry-standard for cloud platforms
- **Security:** 10% allocation demonstrates proper security prioritization
- **Open Source:** 100% of deliverables open source maximizes community value

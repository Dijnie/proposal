## 🎯 Project Overview

### The Problem
Cardano's CIP-68 standard enables dynamic NFTs (updatable metadata), but:
- Requires Plutus smart contract expertise (barrier for 95% of creators)
- Current platforms (NMKR, etc.) focus on static CIP-25 NFTs
- Gaming, ticketing, membership projects forced to use other blockchains
- Cardano missing $3.3B gaming + $85B ticketing markets

### The Solution: Proteus
**No-code platform + developer API for dynamic NFT management**

**For Creators (No-Code Dashboard):**
- Visual collection creator (no smart contract coding)
- Drag-and-drop rule automation ("IF time > date THEN update status")
- Batch mint 10,000 NFTs in minutes
- Template library (gaming, tickets, memberships, art)

**For Developers (API/SDK):**
- REST API + JavaScript/Python SDKs
- Pre-audited CIP-68 smart contracts
- Webhook integrations
- 80% faster than custom implementation

### Key Differentiators
1. **Only CIP-68 specialized platform** (not retrofitted from CIP-25 tools)
2. **Dual interface** (no-code + pro-code, not either/or)
3. **Rule-based automation** (no coding for common patterns)
4. **Open architecture** (APIs, SDKs enable integrations)
5. **Cost optimized** (smart batching reduces tx fees 60-80%)

- **10-20 projects** retained that would've chosen other chains
- **5% CIP-68 adoption** (vs. <1% baseline)

### Success Measurement
- On-chain metrics (blockchain explorer verifiable)

Transaction volume\n2. Monthly Active Users.\n\nIncreasing these metrics is widely recognized as the most critical objective of the ecosystem at this point in time. The 200k ADA requested will be used to increase these metrics as efficiently as possible, with a goal of achieving a 500x multiple of the requested Catalyst funding in on-chain volume generated over the lifetime of the initiative. Transactions will serve to capture price spreads and/or arbitrage opportunities with the goal of profitable trading while maximizing daily trading volume. This will be executed through the use of the Surge protocol, a new Cardano native trade automation platform detailed in the following section.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"Surge is the first fully non-custodial trade automation platform on Cardano. It allows holders of ADA or any Cardano native asset to deploy algorithmic trading strategies directly from their personal device in a private and permissionless environment.\n\nOver 90% of trading volume in both traditional finance and decentralized finance is executed by computers rather than manually. Surge brings this power and volume potential to Cardano - and more precisely to every person in Cardano - as the individuals and teams that make up the ecosystem hold vast amounts of ADA and native assets and therefore have the power to create the on-chain activity that can change how Cardano is perceived, the extent to which it is invested in, and the speed at which it is adopted.\n\nSurge is uniquely accessible. Cardano users of any skill level are able to deploy and manage trading strategies on Surge. For this reason, the acceleration of Cardano’s metrics such as MAUs and transaction volume can be a community effort, where individuals and teams contribute to the expansion of chain activity with their own resources and likewise mutually and constructively benefit from the efforts of their peers.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe realistic measures of success, ideally with on-chain metrics.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"Goals:\n\n1. 500,000 to 5 million daily Cardano DEX Volume accross 1 or more CNT pairs for a duration of 3 to 8+ months (15 million to 150 million monthly Cardano DEX volume)\n2. 500 to 5000 monthly active Cardano wallets","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Your Project and Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","description":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","format":null,"answer":"The requested 200k ADA will be deployed on the Surge protocol.

Surge aims to use Catalyst funds to increase two of these metrics as efficiently as possible per Catalyst-ADA-used.\n\n\n\nTo quote Charles Hoskinson directly:\n\n\n\n“MAUs, TVL, and transaction volume. That is what the VCs care about. I sat down with the a16z people, the Electric Capital people, the Pantera people, the Ark people. I sat down with about twenty-five VCs and asked, ‘If you could only pick three things, what do you care about?’ These are the guys who deploy billions of dollars of capital, and they said, ‘your MAUs, your TVL, and your transaction volume.

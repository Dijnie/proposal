By creating five simple, open\\-source dApp templates with comprehensive documentation, we will provide a practical learning path that empowers developers and accelerates Hydra adoption\\._\n\n\n\n**The Problem**\n\n\n\n- Hydra is Cardano's revolutionary Layer 2 scaling solution, promising near-instant transactions at a minimal cost. Its potential to enable micropayments, gaming, and other high-frequency interactions is immense. However, the success of any foundational technology depends entirely on developer adoption. Currently, we face a significant barrier to Hydra's adoption.\n- The core problem is the lack of practical, simple, and accessible learning materials. Developers who want to build on Hydra are overwhelmed by the theoretical complexity of state channels and the absence of concrete, step-by-step source code examples. Existing examples are often too complex, focusing on advanced use cases like auctions, which creates a large gap for newcomers. They have no clear (entry point) or learning path to get from zero to building their first dApp.\n- This (chicken and egg) situation is slowing down the entire ecosystem's progress: developers aren't building due to the lack of simple examples, and users have no dApps to use. If this barrier to entry is not addressed, Hydra's true potential will never be realized, and Cardano will lose a critical competitive advantage in scalability. We need a bridge to connect theory with practice.\n\n\n\n**The Solution**\n\n\n\n- Our solution is a developer-focused project to create dApp templates that run on L2-Hydra. We will build and provide the open-source code for five sample dApps on Hydra, including both on-chain and off-chain components. These are designed as an incremental learning path to guide developers from the most basic concepts to core interactive applications.\n- Each dApp will serve as a practical lesson, addressing a few key challenges:\n- \n- HydraTipJar: Teaches the fundamental lifecycle and basic transactions of a Hydra Head.\n- HydraPact: Introduces multi-party agreement logic and simple shared states.\n- HydraPoll: Illustrates how to collect and aggregate data from multiple participants within a Head.\n- HydraTicTacToe: Demonstrates how to build a turn-based interactive application, a foundation for on-chain gaming.\n- HydraTicket: Showcases a real-world business model (conditional access) using Hydra transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n_The final product is not just five working dApps, but more importantly, a comprehensive educational toolkit\\. We are committed to providing:_\n\n\n\n- 100% Open-Source Code: The entire frontend and smart contract code will be made public on GitHub, with detailed comments.\n- Detailed Tutorials: Each dApp will have a step-by-step guide explaining the (Why) and the (How).\n- Video Demos: Short videos will be produced to demonstrate how each dApp works and to explain its technical flow.\n- This project will directly break down the barrier to entry, empowering developers by giving them the tools they truly need. It will transform Hydra from a complex concept into a powerful and accessible tool, fostering a new wave of innovation and building on Cardano's Layer 2.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"_The impact of this project goes far beyond the creation of five sample applications\\. We will create a ripple effect, starting with the developer community in Vietnam and expanding globally, thereby significantly boosting the adoption and development on Hydra\\._\n\n\n\n**1\\. Direct Impact on the Vietnamese Developer Community**\n\n\n\n_As Cardano2vn \\(C2VN\\), we have a unique strategic advantage\\. We have built an extensive network with leading universities, Information Technology student communities, and professional developers across Vietnam\\. This project will be a powerful tool for us to:_\n\n\n\n- Train and Integrate: We will directly use these five dApp templates as core material for workshops, hackathons, and even integrate them into the curriculum of our partner IT faculties. This will create a new generation of developers who not only know about Cardano but are also capable of building directly on Layer 2.\n- Convert Talent: Vietnam is a global technology hub with an abundant talent pool. By providing a clear and practical learning path, we will convert talented Web2 developers into Web3 builders on the Cardano platform, creating a sustainable resource for the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n**2\\. Impact on the Global Developer Community**\n\n\n\n_The biggest barrier to Hydra today is its complexity and the lack of resources for beginners\\. Our solution will address this problem on a global scale:_\n\n\n\n- Foundational Boilerplate Library: These five dApps, with their fully open-source code and detailed English documentation, will become a foundational boilerplate library for anyone looking to start with Hydra. A developer in Brazil, Nigeria, or South Korea can clone our repository and have a running application in just a few hours, instead of weeks.\n- Multiplier Effect: Every developer who uses our source code to build their own project is a testament to this project's impact. By providing the initial (building blocks,) we activate and empower countless other builders, creating a global multiplier effect at no extra cost.\n\n\n\n**3\\. Long\\-term Impact on the Cardano Ecosystem**\n\n\n\n_By lowering the barrier to entry for Hydra, this project directly contributes to the growth and health of the entire Cardano netw_ork:\n\n\n\n- Driving Layer 2 Adoption: As building on Hydra becomes easier, the number of dApps and projects using Layer 2 will increase. This enhances the network's utility, attracts more users, and increases transaction volume.\n- Strengthening Competitiveness: A vibrant Layer 2 ecosystem is vital for Cardano's long-term competitiveness. Our project is a concrete, measurable step toward building that ecosystem, ensuring Cardano remains a fast, low-cost, and scalable platform.\n- In summary, investing in this project is not just an investment in five dApps. It is an investment in building a community of Hydra developers, starting from a solid foundation in Vietnam and expanding to the entire world.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

The value is demonstrated across three key dimensions:_\n\n\n\n**1\\. Strategic Investment with a High, Compounding ROI**\n\n\n\nThe true value of this project is not in the five dApps themselves, but in the powerful multiplier effect they create. These open-source templates and tutorials are essential infrastructure that lowers the barrier to entry to Hydra. By providing the foundational \"building blocks,\" we save countless future developers weeks or even months of work. This initial investment from the treasury will be repaid many times over through the time and resources saved across the ecosystem, empowering a new wave of innovation on Layer 2.\n\n\n\n**2\\. Cost\\-Effective and Responsible Budgeting**\n\n\n\nThis high return on investment is achieved through a lean, expert team and a responsibly structured budget.\n\n\n\n- **Competitive Rates: **Our budget is based on a team located in Vietnam, a global tech hub with competitive costs. Our proposed self-employed rates are significantly more cost-effective than the lower-end US and European averages (often cited at ~$50/hr for similar roles like JavaScript developers or project managers). These rates account for all employment overheads of the contracted resources.\n- **Acceptance of Currency Risk: **Crucially, our team is taking on the full currency risk of being paid in ADA. This means that a decline in ADA's price would result in a lower payment for our work. Conversely, any increase in ADA's price would reward our contribution and long-term belief. This acceptance of volatility is a clear demonstration of our commitment to and investment in the success of the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n\n\n**3\\. Building a Sustainable, Global Asset**\n\n\n\n- Ultimately, this funding creates a lasting, free, and open-source asset for the entire global community. The cost of not doing this project—leaving Hydra as a powerful but inaccessible technology for new builders—is far greater than the modest investment we are requesting.\n- Given these factors—a high-impact strategic deliverable, a powerful multiplier effect, and a cost-effective budget executed by a team willing to share currency risk—we believe this proposal offers outstanding value for money for the Cardano Treasury.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal is a non-technical initiative, with ≤20% of the budget for tech support.","description":"Scope Fit:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal provides verifiable evidence (portfolio, links, reports) of the team's ability to deliver the project.","description":"Relevant Experience:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes clear objectives with both Output Metrics (what proposal did) and Adoption-Focused Metrics (what effect proposal had).","description":"Clear Goals & KPIs:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly explains the user journey and provides a credible plan for how the project will equip and motivate users for future on-chain activity.","description":"Pathway to Adoption:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the initiative clearly demonstrates how it will grow the Cardano ecosystem or onboard users.","description":"Community Value:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the project plan and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic and well-defined.","description":"Realistic Timeline:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal commits to public outputs and justifies any exceptions.","description":"Public Outputs:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget adheres to all policies: it is for future work, follows the merchandise rule, and excludes establishing local treasuries, incentives/giveaways, re-grants.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/yesNoChoice","title":"Have you previously submitted a project in Catalyst that was funded and is not yet completed?","description":"Do you have not yet completed projects?","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

The proposal focuses on developing the core platform modules that enable secure property onboarding, fractionalization, ownership management, and on-chain yield distribution.\n\n\n\nOur solution uses Cardano smart contracts to convert real properties into regulated digital tokens, allowing users to buy fractions instead of entire buildings. This removes the high capital entry barrier and makes property investing affordable, liquid, transparent, and globally accessible. Each token represents a legally backed ownership share, and all rental income, appreciation, and governance activity can be recorded and executed on-chain.\n\n\n\nWhy We Approach It This Way\n\nTraditional property investment is expensive, paperwork-heavy, slow, and inaccessible to average people, especially in emerging markets. Records are centralized, difficult to verify, and cannot be traded easily. By tokenizing property on Cardano, ownership becomes transparent, affordable, instant to verify, and tradable in small units. Cardano’s low fees, EUTXO model, native tokens, and regulated identity standards make it a strong foundation for real-world asset deployment.\n\n\n\nWhat This Proposal Will Build\n\nWith Catalyst funding, RareA will deliver the following core system components:\n\n\n\nProperty Tokenization Module\n\n\n\nSmart contracts for registering verified real estate assets\n\n\n\nLegal metadata binding property documents to on-chain tokens\n\n\n\nFractional minting and issuance of ownership tokens\n\n\n\nOwnership & Compliance Layer\n\n\n\nWallet-based user onboarding\n\n\n\nKYC/AML identity integration for regulated participation\n\n\n\nAutomated ownership transfer rules\n\n\n\nYield Distribution Engine\n\n\n\nSmart contracts for proportional payout of rental income or asset appreciation\n\n\n\nOn-chain reporting with auditable logs\n\n\n\nSecondary Marketplace Foundation\n\n\n\nPeer-to-peer transfer function for reselling fractions\n\n\n\nPricing and transaction settlement mechanisms\n\n\n\nGovernance Framework\n\n\n\nToken-based voting system for investor decision-making\n\n\n\nProperty-level DAO configuration\n\n\n\nWho the Project Will Engage\n\n\n\nRetail investors seeking affordable, fractional property ownership\n\n\n\nProperty owners and developers wanting alternative fundraising liquidity\n\n\n\nDiaspora and cross-border investors unable to participate today\n\n\n\nReal estate agencies onboarding verified property inventory\n\n\n\nRegulators and legal partners for compliant asset issuance\n\n\n\nCardano community members for testing, governance, and adoption\n\n\n\nWhat Makes RareA Unique\n\nRareA is designed specifically for real estate accessibility in markets where financial inclusion is weakest.

Even small-scale adoption significantly increases on-chain settlement volume, token circulation, wallet growth, and enterprise adoption. RareA demonstrates Cardano as a capable infrastructure for large-scale regulated financial systems, driving:\n\n\n\nNew users and liquidity into Cardano\n\n\n\nReal-world economic value backed by actual assets\n\n\n\nEnterprise credibility for governments, real estate institutions, and global markets\n\n\n\nExpansion of Cardano’s position as a preferred chain for real-world assets\n\n\n\nRareA converts real estate from a slow, exclusive, manual process into a blockchain-powered financial product that is global, transparent, accessible, and user-controlled—all anchored on Cardano.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"RareA delivers a production-ready implementation of legally-compliant fractional real estate tokenization on Cardano, directly advancing the blockchain's real-world asset (RWA) capabilities and demonstrating enterprise-grade utility to attract institutional adoption.\n\n1. Strategic Value to the Cardano Ecosystem\n\nRareA addresses Strategic Fit, Feasibility, and impact, the three core evaluation criteria, by building critical RWA infrastructure that positions Cardano competitively in a market projected to reach $2 trillion by 2030.\n\nImmediate Ecosystem Benefits:\n\n•\tTechnical Leadership: Provides the first open-source, legally-integrated fractional property ownership system on Cardano, filling a documented gap in the ecosystem's RWA tooling\n\n•\tDeveloper Enablement: Delivers reusable smart contract primitives, legal templates, and integration patterns that dramatically reduce time-to-market for future RWA builders\n\n•\tEUTXO Validation: Demonstrates Cardano's technical advantages for regulated financial systems through deterministic transaction handling and built-in compliance logic\n\n•\tNetwork Effects: Attracts real estate developers, institutional investors, and compliance-focused builders to explore Cardano as their RWA platform\n\n•\tRegulatory Positioning: Establishes precedent for legally-compliant tokenization, making Cardano more attractive to enterprise partners requiring regulatory certainty\n\nCompetitive Differentiation: Similar successful Cardano RWA projects like Empowa and CSWAP have demonstrated real-world adoption and industrial use-case partnerships, validating market demand. RareA extends this foundation with purpose-built real estate fractionalization, a high-value segment currently dominated by Ethereum-based solutions.\n\n1. Measurable Impact and Success Metrics\n\nSuccess will be tracked through concrete, verifiable on-chain data and community engagement metrics that align with Catalyst's requirement for tangible, measurable evidence.\n\nPrimary Success Indicators:\n\nTestnet Activity\n\n•\t20,000–30,000 transactions demonstrating platform functionality\n\n•\t5,000–10,000 fractional ownership tokens minted across test properties\n\n•\t2,000–4,000 unique wallet addresses interacting with contracts\n\n•\t800–1,500 simulated revenue distribution events\n\n•\t1,000–2,000 DAO governance interactions (proposals, votes, delegations)\n\nCommunity Adoption Metrics\n\n•\t1,500–3,000 registered platform users completing KYC simulation\n\n•\t400–800 active community testers providing structured feedback\n\n•\t200–400 GitHub engagements (stars, forks, code contributions)\n\n•\t100–200 detailed feedback submissions via established channels\n\n•\t8–15 ecosystem partnerships or integration commitments\n\nKnowledge Transfer Impact\n\n•\t5–10 technical workshops/presentations at Cardano community events\n\n•\t3–5 published case studies demonstrating implementation patterns\n\n•\tDocumentation page views and developer onboarding completions tracked monthly\n\nBenchmark Context: These targets align with successful Cardano testnet launches like CSWAP's RWA expansion and Empowa's NSE tokenization pilot, which demonstrated measurable traction before mainnet deployment. Our conservative estimates reflect realistic MVP adoption while providing clear success thresholds.\n\n1.

This represents excellent value for the ecosystem, as the budget is narrowly focused on components that directly produce measurable on-chain activity and reusable RWA infrastructure.\n\nThe cost is justified by the highly technical nature of the work. Developing secure real-estate tokenization flows, Plutus/Aiken smart contracts, automated yield distribution, and proof-based ownership systems requires senior-level blockchain engineering. Industry-standard rates for blockchain engineers typically range from $40–$150+ per hour, and full blockchain MVP builds often cost $20,000–$250,000+, depending on complexity. Within this context, a 150,000 ADA budget (~mid-range MVP cost) is a conservative request for delivering a complete, testable RWA prototype.\n\nCatalyst precedents demonstrate that larger budgets have historically been allocated for RWA infrastructure. For example, teams like CSWAP Systems, ChainCrib, and other Cardano RWA-focused initiatives have received or requested significantly higher amounts, validating that the ecosystem recognizes the complexity and value of funding regulated, real-world financial applications. RareA continues this trajectory by offering a targeted, builder-friendly RWA implementation designed from the start to be reused by future ecosystem projects.\n\nThe allocation of funds is also highly efficient. Rather than being spread across marketing, ideation, or exploratory research, the budget is focused almost entirely on senior engineering, smart-contract development, backend integration, UI implementation, and public testnet deployment. These are the components that produce real value on-chain and accelerate Cardano’s position within the rapidly expanding tokenized-assets market.\n\nAdditionally, all outputs, contracts, templates, integration guides, identity workflows, and APIs will be fully open-source, reducing development costs for other teams and allowing Catalyst to benefit repeatedly from a single investment. This creates ecosystem-wide leverage and multiplies the long-term value of the initial funding.\n\nFinally, transparency is guaranteed through milestone-based releases, testnet deployment, GitHub commits, public demos, and verifiable on-chain transaction IDs, giving Catalyst voters complete visibility into the project’s progress and ensuring responsible, accountable fund usage.\n\nWhat 1 ADA Delivers (5-Year Value Breakdown)\n\nBased on moderate, realistic adoption projections from prior Cardano MVPs, RareA is expected to generate between 250,000–350,000 on-chain transactions and onboard 30,000–50,000 users within 5 years (testnet + mainnet rollout).\n\n1 ADA = Real, Measurable Ecosystem Impact\n\nCategory\t5-Year Projection\tCost per Unit (150,000 ADA)\n\nOn-chain transactions generated\t250,000 – 350,000\t0.43 – 0.60 ADA per transaction\n\nUsers onboarded / interacting\t30,000 – 50,000\t3 – 5 ADA per user\n\nDevelopers reusing open-source components\t200 – 400\t375 – 750 ADA per developer\n\nGovernance & token-holder actions\t15,000 – 25,000\t6 – 10 ADA per action\n\nInterpretation of Value\n\n•\tFor less than 1 ADA, the Cardano network gains a real, measurable on-chain RWA transaction.\n\n•\tFor 3–5 ADA, a new user is onboarded into the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n•\tFor 375–750 ADA, an entire developer team gains access to reusable RWA smart-contract templates and technical documentation.\n\n•\tEach governance cycle costs only 6–10 ADA, supporting decentralized ownership models.\n\nThis cost-per-impact ratio is exceptionally competitive. Comparable RWA prototypes built on other blockchains (Polygon, Avalanche, Ethereum L2s) typically require 3–5× higher funding, demonstrating that RareA delivers far more measurable value per unit of funding.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only; excludes retroactive funding, incentives, giveaways, re-granting, or sub-treasuries.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

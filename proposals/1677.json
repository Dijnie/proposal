While carbon accounting infrastructure exists for aviation, shipping, and ground transportation, the space industry has been operating without standardized, independently verified emissions measurement. We offer the first blockchain oracle specifically designed for rocket launch emissions, a completely greenfield application.\n\n**=&gt; The data shows** 261 orbital launches in 2024 generated approximately 50,000 tons of CO₂, yet every launch provider calculates emissions differently.\n\n**=&gt; Significant increase from previous years**, with the Satellite Industry Association (SIA) reporting that 2024 saw a historic number of launches and a record 2,172 tons of material sent into Earth orbit. The previous year, 2023, had 223 orbital launches, and 2022 had 186 but there is little available on the emmissions generated by these rocket launches.\n\n**=&gt; There is no 'ICAO for space'** (International Civil Aviation Organization sets aviation standards) so we're not improving an existing system, we’re building the foundational infrastructure from scratch right here on Cardano.\n\n**Innovation \\#1:** Industrial IoT Oracle on Cardano (Technical First).\n\n- Cardano's first space industry oracle bringing real world sensor data on-chain at scale.\n- Existing Cardano oracles (Charli3, Orcfax): Focus on financial data feeds. They pull data from APIs and centralized sources\n\n**=&gt; How we differ:**\n\n- Physical IoT sensors at industrial sites (launch pads)\n- Real time telemetry during high stakes operations (rocket launches)\n- Integration with proprietary industrial systems (launch computers, fuel management)\n- Zero knowledge proofs to protect commercial IP while proving data validity\n\n**=&gt; Why Cardano:**\n\n- We leverage eUTXO's deterministic nature for industrial compliance data (critical for ESG audits).\n- Plutus formal verification for smart contracts handling green finance\n- Prototype Hydra for high-throughput sensor data\n\nDemonstrating Cardano's viability beyond DeFi and Gaming use cases.\n\n**=&gt; No other blockchain** has proven industrial IoT oracle capability at this scale for this industry.  We know because we have checked and spoken to them recently at DevConnect in Argentina.\n\n**Innovation \\#2**: Zero-Knowledge Privacy for Commercial Space Operations.\n\n**The Problem**\n\n- Launch providers won't share telemetry data publicly.\n- Fuel consumption profiles, thrust curves, and trajectory data reveal competitive advantages\n- Manual audits require sharing this data with third party auditors, creating IP leakage risk.\n\n**Our Solution**\n\n- ZK-SNARK proofs allow us to prove &quot;Launch X emitted Y tons CO₂&quot; **without revealing the underlying telemetry\\.**\n- What goes on-chain (public): &quot;387.4 tons CO₂e&quot;\n- What stays private: Exact fuel mass, burn time, thrust profile, payload distribution.\n\nThis is the first application of zero knowledge proofs to industrial emissions accounting.\n\n**Innovation \\#3**: Automated Offset Certification Pipeline.\n\n**Our Process:**\n\n1. Launch happens → IoT sensors capture data in real time\n2. Oracle feeds emissions to Cardano in minutes not weeks\n3. Smart contract records emissions on-chain (immutable)\n4. Company purchases offsets from a certified provider\n5. Smart contract verifies offset retirement certificates (on-chain proof)\n6. When emissions + offsets match → Carbon neutral certificate auto minted\n7. ESG report generator pulls on-chain data → Produces 40-page report (30 days vs. 6 months sta dard pipeline).\n\n**Innovation \\#4:** Emissions Data-as-a-Service Marketplace\n\nWhat doesn't exist today: A market for verified space industry emissions data.\n\nWho needs this data:\n\n- Space insurers for risk modelling\n- ESG rating agencies have an industry data gap\n- Satellite operators need Scope 3 data as best as possible\n- Academic researchers need emissions baselines\n\n**Our innovation: **A Decentralized data marketplace on Cardano where:\n\n- Launch providers control their data via anonymized sharing\n- Data buyers pay in ADA for access (micropayments via smart contracts)\n- Revenue split automated (70% launch provider, 30% Company)\n- IPFS storage + on-chain access control (pay → receive decryption key)\n\n**Precedent**: Ocean Protocol and Streamr have built decentralized data marketplaces, but not for industrial compliance data, not for space, and not with this revenue-sharing model where the data originators (launch providers) get paid.\n\n**Our point of difference**: We're not just selling data, we're creating a new asset class (verified space emissions information) and a new revenue stream for launch providers who monetize their compliance data.\n\n**Innovation \\#5**: Green Finance Infrastructure for Space Industry.\n\n**The gap: **Launch providers are locked out of $2B+ in green financing because they lack the verified emissions data ESG capital requires. Green bonds, sustainability linked loans and climate tech grants all demand credible carbon accounting, which doesn't really exist for space.\n\n**We unlock:**\n\n- Sustainability linked loans\n- ESG capital\n- Climate grants\n\n**Innovation:** We believe this is the first time blockchain infrastructure has been purpose built to unlock green finance for an entire industry. We're building the data infrastructure that makes green finance possible for space.\n\n**Innovation \\#6**: Academic Grade Methodology with UN Framework Heritage.\n\n**=&gt; Our approach: **\n\n- Built on Dr. Makane Faye's UN adopted framework for sectoral digital strategies (UNECA, 20+ years developing e-government, e-agriculture, ICT measurement methodologies globally).

For a modest budget, we are building infrastructure that connects Cardano to the rapidly expanding global space industry, where both emissions transparency and ESG accountability are becoming regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nThe cost is focused on technical execution, with the majority allocated to development and the two founders who will deliver the core oracle, ZK verification prototype, emissions engine, and testnet deployment. In return, Cardano gains a reusable open-source oracle framework, a high visibility real world use case, and an opportunity to differentiate itself as a chain capable of handling trusted industrial data rather than speculative assets alone.\n\n\n\nThis represents excellent value for money: a relatively small investment yields outsized exposure, demonstrates Cardano’s utility to an entirely new sector, and positions the ecosystem as a credible platform for enterprise class RWA, ESG, and DePIN integrations.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only; excludes retroactive funding, incentives, giveaways, re-granting, or sub-treasuries.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

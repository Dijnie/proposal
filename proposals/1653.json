The learning curve is too steep. Haskell, fragmented tooling, scattered documentation. They leave for easier chains, taking their dApps, users, and innovation with them.\n\n\n\nThis problem is far worse today because expectations have changed. With more than 33 million Copilot users and tools like Cursor becoming standard, everyone from developers to product managers now codes with AI at their side. They expect instant answers, guidance, and clarity as they build. If Cardano cannot meet that expectation, they assume the ecosystem is behind. To keep these builders, Cardano must become the first AI-powered blockchain environment, where intelligent assistance is the default experience rather than a luxury.\n\n\n\nThe solution is AI assistance, but building it takes months. A production Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline requires 2-3 months of engineering. Keeping it synced with evolving docs takes another month. Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration adds more time. Custom ChatGPT for websites keeps adding months. Most teams never start at all.\n\n\n\nMimir eliminates this timeline entirely. One config file deploys everything: RAG pipeline, MCP integration, and custom ChatGPT. What took months now takes minutes.\n\n\n\nThe core is an advanced RAG system with Contextual Retrieval. Standard RAG loses critical context when documents are split into chunks. Mimir adds an LLM preprocessing step that generates specific context for each chunk before embedding, ensuring developers get not just code snippets but full understanding of security implications and design patterns.\n\n\n\nSetup requires only a config file. Provide your GitHub docs URL, Supabase credentials, and LLM API keys. Deploy once. The system handles everything: chunking, context generation, embedding creation, and index maintenance. GitHub webhooks keep it synced automatically using checksums, so only changed content gets re-embedded.\n\n\n\nOnce the RAG pipeline is live, configure your backend URL and publish the MCP server as a package to npm. It integrates directly into VSCode and Cursor, wrapping your project's functionality into tools that AI agents can call directly. Developers describe what they want in natural language, and the AI executes functions, queries state, and runs tests.\n\n\n\nThe same RAG infrastructure powers custom ChatGPT widgets on websites. Users get instant answers from your documentation, dramatically improving onboarding and reducing support tickets.\n\n\n\nMost critically for web3, code written with MCP assistance follows current best practices from up-to-date documentation, not outdated training data. This is essential where a single mistake can mean lost funds. Mimir ensures developers get current, safe patterns, dramatically reducing vulnerability risks.\n\n\n\nFor Cardano projects, the cost of lacking this infrastructure is severe. Teams spend 4 to 6 months building their own RAG systems instead of delivering the DEX, NFT marketplace, or governance product that attracts users. New developers lose their first month just learning how to perform basic transactions instead of adding value. Talented builders who hit friction early simply leave, taking their dApp ideas, their users, and their momentum with them. Mimir changes the game. Deploy in an afternoon, redirect months of engineering effort back into real product development, enable contributors on day one, and retain the builders who would otherwise walk away.\n\n\n\nSmall projects get the same AI infrastructure as major companies. Solo developers get the same assistance as established teams. With Mimir barrier isn't lowered. It's removed.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"Mimir directly addresses Cardano's biggest growth bottleneck: developer accessibility. Every project that deploys Mimir becomes a gateway that keeps developers in the ecosystem instead of losing them to complexity.\n\n\n\nThe immediate impact is measurable. Each team/project save 4-6 months of engineering time they would spend building AI infrastructure, redirecting that capacity to building actual dApps. New developers onboard in days instead of weeks, becoming productive contributors faster. Support teams stop drowning in basic documentation questions, freeing them to solve real problems.\n\n\n\nThe compounding impact is ecosystem-wide. As more projects deploy Mimir and improve their documentation for AI compatibility, the quality of Cardano's collective knowledge base rises. Better documentation means better AI assistance across all projects.\n\n\n\nDevelopers who stay because of accessible tooling build the next generation of dApps. Projects that ship faster attract more users. Users who onboard smoothly bring more users.\n\n\n\nThis creates a virtuous cycle. Cardano's technical sophistication stops being a barrier and becomes accessible. The ecosystem that has the strongest technology gains the developer velocity it needs to compete. Projects that would have failed at onboarding succeed. Developers who would have left stay and build. Users stop leaving out of confusion and start actually using the product.\n\n\n\nMost critically, Mimir proves that Cardano's complexity doesn't need to be simplified, just made accessible. This preserves what makes Cardano superior while eliminating what makes it intimidating. The result is an ecosystem that grows without compromising its technical foundations.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

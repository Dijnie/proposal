Most blockchain racing titles either fix stats at mint or rely on ad-hoc burn/re-mint flows and off-chain state. On Cardano, racing options remain relatively limited, so turning Cardano Racers into a flagship title with truly upgradeable assets is a direct win for players and for the ecosystem.\n\nOur proposal is innovative in two ways. First, we introduce standardised, onchain, upgradeable NFTs (CIP-68 + CIP-67) into a production racing game, so cars and drivers can evolve with cosmetics, temporary boosts, and stat changes driven by the NITRO native token. These improved NFTs will remain first-class Cardano assets. Second, we design and deliver a clean migration path from legacy CIP-25 to CIP-68 NFTs, including backend APIs, swap endpoints, and user guides, so existing players can bring their current cars and drivers forward without losing value.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"The MVP will demonstrate live, upgradeable game assets in Cardano Racers using CIP-68/CIP-67. Players will be able to connect a Cardano wallet, view their existing CIP-25 car and driver NFTs, and smoothly migrate them to new CIP-68 “dynamic” versions. After migration, they can apply NITRO-driven upgrades (cosmetic changes, temporary boosts, and stat increases) and see those changes reflected both in-game and in on-chain metadata.\n\nThe prototype will be accessible through the existing Cardano Racers web client at cardanoracers.com, initially via a dedicated flow for testing and hardening the new CIP-68 features, and then rolled out to the wider mainnet player base once the contracts and APIs are battle-tested.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe realistic measures of success, ideally with on-chain metrics.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"Success will be measured by tracking how many legacy CIP-25 car and driver NFTs are migrated to CIP-68 and what share of the total collection that represents. We will monitor the number of unique wallets interacting with the new contracts, the volume of NITRO used in upgrade flows, and the frequency of metadata-update transactions touching the new NFT type.\n\nWe will also look at player behaviour and ecosystem impact: changes in DAU/MAU and returning-player rates for wallets that hold CIP-68 assets, and the total Cardano transaction volume driven by the new CIP-68 infrastructure. Together, these metrics will show whether dynamic NFTs actually deepen engagement and generate meaningful activity, rather than being a purely novel upgrade.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Your Project and Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","description":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","format":null,"answer":"We aim to solve a very concrete limitation: Cardano Racers’ current CIP-25 NFTs are static, so cars and drivers cannot naturally evolve as players race, spend NITRO, or earn rewards. That holds back progression, tuning, and player retention in an otherwise live Cardano title. Our solution is to upgrade the game’s asset model to CIP-68, with CIP-67-compliant naming, and wire this cleanly into the existing Racers backend and game client.\n\nPractically, this means introducing reference NFTs and a dedicated metadata validator for cars and drivers, migrating the existing CIP-25 collection to CIP-68, and exposing admin and player flows through APIs and the web client. Players will be able to see their current cars and drivers, swap them for dynamic CIP-68 versions, and then apply cosmetics, temporary boosts, and NITRO-driven stat upgrades that are reflected directly in on-chain metadata.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"This project turns Cardano Racers into a live showcase of dynamic game NFTs on Cardano. By upgrading the existing CIP-25 collection to CIP-68 and wiring NITRO-driven upgrades directly into onchain metadata, we create a concrete example of how Cardano can support progression-based gaming without sacrificing decentralisation. For the wider ecosystem, this raises the profile of Cardano as a home for interactive GameFi, gives existing players a richer, more durable reason to keep using their wallets, and provides other teams with a practical blueprint for handling CIP-25 to CIP-68 migrations.\n\nWe will measure impact quantitatively through on-chain and behavioural metrics: the proportion of the CIP-25 car/driver collection successfully migrated to CIP-68, the number of unique wallets interacting with the new contracts, the volume of NITRO used in upgrade flows, and the frequency of metadata updates on the new NFT type. On the player side, we will track changes in DAU/MAU, returning-player rates for wallets holding CIP-68 assets, and the total Cardano transaction volume attributable to the new infrastructure. These metrics show whether dynamic NFTs deepen engagement and drive meaningful onchain activity rather than remaining a purely novel enhancement.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

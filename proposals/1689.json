Admin enables “Cardano (ADA)” and sets a processor API key + webhook—or a public wallet for self-custody.\n2. Buyer chooses Cardano (ADA) at checkout and pays with Lace/Nami/Eternl/Flint.\n3. Payment confirms; the order is marked Paid, inventory updates, and the invoice reconciles automatically.\n\n**Odoo POS\\(in\\-store\\)**\n\n1. Cashier selects Cardano (ADA) as the tender.\n2. POS shows a QR/payment link; the customer pays with Lace, Nami, Eternl, or Flint.\n3. On confirmation, the sale closes; the receipt prints and daily totals include ADA—no manual steps.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/DZhqRjxg/Telegram-Web-Image.png)\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/nrBfML4f/Telegram-Web-Image-(1).png)\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/xTn4LgYk/Telegram-Web-Image-(2).png)![](https://i.postimg.cc/1t0Kth8M/Telegram-Web-Image-(3).png)![](https://i.postimg.cc/KcNNhbS5/Telegram-Web-Image-(4).png)","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"**Real\\-world utility at scale**: Makes ADA a daily payment option inside Odoo,an ERP used by ~15M+ users with 16k+ partners—so Cardano moves  to commerce across retail, services, and subscriptions.\n\n\n\n**Frictionless merchant onboarding**: Odoo merchants enable ADA like Stripe/PayPal (web + POS).

ecosystem?","description":"How does the cost of the project represent value for the Cardano ecosystem?","format":null,"answer":"**High leverage integration**: One open-source module makes ADA a first-class tender across Odoo eCommerce and POS—a platform with millions of users. A single build unlocks many merchants and verticals, multiplying ecosystem impact.\n\n\n\n**Public good, reusable code**: Delivered under open licenses with docs, tests, and demo flows. Other teams can fork the Cardano payment + webhook patterns (CIP-13 now, CIP-30 next) for different ERPs/CMSs—compounding value beyond this project.\n\n\n\n**Measured, auditable outcomes**: Testnet-only scope keeps costs lean while proving feasibility. Success is tied to verifiable metrics (completed testnet payments, confirm times, refund rates) and milestone-gated deliverables (repo tags, videos, reports).\n\n\n\n\n\n**Real adoption path, low lock\\-in**: Self-custody by default and optional processor mode reduce barriers and long-term vendor costs for merchants, aligning with Cardano’s decentralization ethos and encouraging sustained use of ADA.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Efficient use of funds**: Budget focuses on engineering, QA, docs, and a public no spend on production distribution. If just 50 merchants eventually activate from this foundation, the effective cost per merchant enabled is modest relative to traditional gateway integrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Ecosystem flywheel**: Merchant payments drive wallet activity, analytics, and future add-ons (stablecoins, loyalty, DID receipts). The project seeds real-world utility that others in the Cardano stack can build on, maximizing the network’s ROI.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only; excludes retroactive funding, incentives, giveaways, re-granting, or sub-treasuries.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

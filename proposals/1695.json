CENTRALIZED DATABASES \\(WEB2 INNOVATION\\)**\n    1. Incumbents like OLX Autos or Carro rely on SQL databases where an admin can be bribed to delete a \"Flood Damage\" record. Ototentik replaces this with an On-Chain Registry. By using Abstracted Wallets, every inspection report is cryptographically signed by a verified engineer. Once minted, the record is immutable. Not even our developers can alter the history, eliminating the \"Insider Threat.\"\n2. **PERMANENT STORAGE VS\\. BROKEN LINKS \\(WEB3 INNOVATION\\)**\n    1. Most NFT projects store metadata on IPFS (which vanishes if pinning stops) or centralized servers. Ototentik utilizes Arweave for \"Permaweb\" storage. We pay once, and the inspection photos/PDFs are stored for 200+ years. This ensures a car bought today can be verified in 2045, solving the \"Link Rot\" problem of traditional NFTs.\n3. **PRIVACY WITHOUT SECRECY \\(MIDNIGHT INNOVATION\\)**\n    1. Sellers often refuse to share history due to privacy laws (UU PDP). Ototentik uses Midnight ZK-Snarks to allow a buyer to verify \"Is this car accident-free?\" receiving a \"True/False\" proof without ever exposing the previous owner's PII (Personally Identifiable Information). This resolves the transparency vs. privacy paradox.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"Our MVP will be a fully functional &quot;End-to-End Verification Pipeline&quot; accessible via a Web Dashboard and a Mobile App. We will build on top of the system that we've created in Fund 13 (CAR-dano) that you can see in the image below.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co.com/G35LF9x9/Frame-166.png)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co.com/0VQfcXfQ/Frame-178.png)\n\n1. **THE INSPECTOR APP \\(ANDROID/FLUTTER\\)**\n    1. Demonstrates: The &quot;Invisible Web3&quot; flow. An inspector will log in using their Google Workspace email. The app will invisibly generate a wallet, sign the inspection data, upload it to Arweave, and mint the result on the Cardano Pre-Prod Testnet (and later Mainnet).\n    2. Key Feature: Offline-first capability using local caching, syncing with the chain once the 4G signal is restored.\n    3. Access: Available as an APK for the PT Inspeksi Mobil Jogja team.\n2. **THE BUYER VERIFICATION PORTAL \\(WEB/MOBILE\\)**\n    1. Demonstrates: The &quot;Trustless Scan.&quot; A user can scan a QR code (or enter a Chassis Number). The portal will query the Registry Contract and Arweave. It will display the &quot;Digital Twin&quot; of the car side-by-side with the current live data.\n    2. Key Feature: A &quot;Red Flag&quot; system. If the blockchain record says &quot;Odometer: 80,000km&quot; but the car is being sold with &quot;40,000km&quot;, the UI will visually alert the user of fraud.\n    3. Access: Publicly accessible URL (e.g., verify.ototentik.id) and a Flutter-based mobile app.\n3. **THE REGISTRY DASHBOARD \\(ADMIN\\)**\n    1. Demonstrates: The governance of the system. We will show how we add/remove authorized inspector wallets on-chain, proving that if an inspector goes rogue, we can revoke their signing rights instantly.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe realistic measures of success, ideally with on-chain metrics.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"We define success through \"Real World Adoption\" and \"Chain Activity.\"\n\n1. **COMMERCIAL ADOPTION \\(THE \"NORTH STAR\"\\)**\n    1. Target: 500 Paid Inspections completed and minted within the pilot period.\n    2. Validation: These are not fake testnet transactions; these are real customers of PT Inspeksi Mobil Jogja paying for a service, where the result happens to be blockchain-verified.\n2. **ON\\-CHAIN VOLUME**\n    1. Minting Transactions: 500+ CIP-68 NFT Mints (1 per car).\n    2. Storage Volume: ~25GB of high-res inspection data permanently stored on Arweave, linked via Cardano metadata.\n    3. Wallet Growth: 15+ Inspector Wallets (Active Signers) and ~300+ Buyer Wallets (Passive Holders/Viewers created via Abstracted accounts).\n3. **FRAUD PREVENTION VALUE**\n    1. Target: Detect at least 10 instances of \"State Drift\" (where the physical car differs from the reported condition) during the pilot.\n    2. Impact: Saving Indonesian consumers approximately Rp 500 Million ($30,000) in potential fraud losses (assuming avg loss of Rp 50M per lemon car).","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Your Project and Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","description":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","format":null,"answer":"# TL;DR\n**Ototentik prevents used car fraud in Indonesia\\.** We use **Abstracted Wallets**, **Arweave**, &amp; **Midnight** to mint immutable vehicle histories, empowering PT Inspeksi Mobil Jogja to eliminate odometer rollback.\n\n# OTOTENTIK PROTOCOL: THE TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE\nOtotentik is not merely a dApp; it is a &quot;Phygital&quot; Verification Protocol that bridges the physical reality of vehicle conditions with the immutable certainty of the Cardano blockchain. Our solution replaces &quot;Trust in People&quot; with &quot;Trust in Code&quot; using a Web2.5 architecture that removes crypto friction for mass adoption.\n\n# THE TECH STACK\n1. **The &quot;Phygital&quot; Bridge \\(Mobile &amp; Frontend\\)**\n    1. Inspector App (Android/Tablet): Built with Flutter. We utilize Abstracted Wallets (via Web3Auth or similar) allowing inspectors to log in with corporate Google Credentials. The app uses cardano-serialization-lib (Rust via FFI) to sign transactions locally on the device without ever exposing a seed phrase.\n    2. Verification Portal (Web): Built with Next.js. It connects to the blockchain to fetch CIP-68 metadata and to Arweave to stream high-res evidence. It features a &quot;Red Flag&quot; UI that visually highlights discrepancies between the blockchain record and the physical car.\n2. **The Storage Layer \\(The &quot;Permaweb&quot;\\)**\n    1. Arweave: We do not use AWS S3 or IPFS (which is prone to &quot;link rot&quot;). We use Arweave for permanent, censorship-resistant storage.\n    2. Irys (formerly Bundlr): We use Irys as a bundling service to upload inspection photos, engine audio files (for AI sound analysis), and PDF reports instantly with finalized transaction hashes, ensuring a seamless UX.\n3. **The Blockchain Layer \\(Cardano \\+ Midnight\\)**\n    1. **Settlement \\(Cardano L1\\):** We use CIP-68 (The Reference Token Standard).\n        1. Reference NFT (000643b0...): Held by the Protocol Smart Contract. Stores the mutable data (Current Mileage, Service Grade).\n        2. User Token (000de140...): Issued to the Car Owner. Represents &quot;Title/Ownership&quot; of the digital twin.\n    2. **Privacy \\(Midnight Sidechain\\):** We deploy a ZK-Snark Circuit on Midnight. This allows the protocol to answer specific queries (e.g., &quot;Is Flood_Damage == False?&quot;) with a mathematical proof, satisfying UU PDP (Indonesian Data Privacy Law) requirements by not revealing the inspector's notes or previous owner's location.\n    3. **Governance \\(Plutus V3\\):** An &quot;Authorized Registry&quot; Smart Contract. This is an on-chain allowlist of Inspector Wallet Addresses. Only wallets in this registry can mint or update vehicle records.\n\n# DETAILED USER FLOWS\n**The Inspector Flow \\(Invisible Web3\\)**\n\n1. **Goal: Create an immutable record without knowing how crypto works\\.**\n2. **Step 1:** Inspector arrives at the garage and opens the Ototentik Tablet App.\n3. **Step 2:** Login via &quot;Sign in with Google&quot; (PT Inspeksi Workspace). Background: The app derives a deterministic private key from the OAuth token.\n4. **Step 3:** Inspector completes the 150-point checklist, takes photos of the chassis/odometer, and records engine sound.\n5. **Step 4:** Inspector hits &quot;Finalize Report.&quot;\n6. **Step 5 \\(Automated\\):**\n    1. App uploads media to Arweave via Irys $\\rightarrow$ Returns ar://hash.\n    2. App constructs a CIP-68 Metadata JSON containing the Hash + VIN + Odometer.\n    3. App signs the Minting Transaction using the invisible wallet.\n    4. Transaction is submitted to Cardano.\n7. **Result: A &quot;Digital Twin&quot; NFT is minted\\. The inspector sees a &quot;Success&quot; animation\\.**\n\n**The Buyer/Seller Flow \\(Trustless Verification\\)**\n\n1. **Goal: Verify a car's history in &lt;10 seconds\\.**\n2. **Step 1:** Buyer finds a used car. Seller claims &quot;Low Mileage (40k km).&quot;\n3. **Step 2:** Buyer scans the Ototentik QR Sticker on the car's door jamb.\n4. **Step 3:** The Ototentik Web Portal opens. It queries the Cardano Blockchain for the latest CIP-68 state.\n5. **Step 4:** The portal fetches the original Arweave Photos from the last inspection (dated 6 months ago).\n6. **Step 5:** The &quot;Red Flag&quot; Check:\n    1. Buyer looks at the physical odometer: 40,000 km.\n    2. Buyer looks at the Blockchain Record: Last Recorded: 85,000 km.\n    3. UI Alert: 🔴 &quot;POSSIBLE TAMPERING DETECTED&quot;\n7. **Step 6 \\(Privacy Mode\\):** If the buyer wants to see &quot;Accident History,&quot; they request a Midnight ZK-Proof. The system returns a green checkmark &quot;Verified Accident-Free&quot; without showing the PDF report containing the previous owner's name.\n\n**The Admin Flow \\(Governance\\)**\n\n1. **Goal: Manage the &quot;Human Oracles\\.&quot;**\n2. **Step 1:** Sumbu Labs Admin accesses the Registry Dashboard.\n3. **Step 2:** A new Inspector is hired by PT Inspeksi. Admin inputs their work email/wallet address into the Dashboard.\n4. **Step 3:** Admin signs a &quot;Grant Authority&quot; transaction. The Smart Contract updates the Allowlist.\n5. **Step 4 \\(Revocation\\):** An inspector is caught taking a bribe. Admin clicks &quot;Revoke&quot;.\n6. **Step 5:** The Smart Contract removes the inspector's address. Any future attempt by that inspector to mint a report will fail on-chain immediately.\n\n# WHY THIS ARCHITECTURE?\n1. **Cost Efficiency**: We use Arweave (pay once) instead of AWS S3 (pay monthly).\n2. **Scalability**: Mithril integration ensures the mobile app doesn't need to download the whole blockchain, allowing it to scale to millions of users.\n3. **Compliance**: Midnight ensures we don't violate privacy laws while still providing transparency.\n4. **Adoption**: Abstracted Wallets mean we don't need to train 50 mechanics on how to manage 24-word seed phrases.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"Ototentik delivers a dual-layer impact strategy: driving **high\\-value utility** for the Cardano ecosystem while **solving a critical $8\\.15B economic crisis** in Indonesia.\n\n# IMPACT ON THE CARDANO COMMUNITY (The &quot;Chain&quot; Value)\n**A\\. Driving &quot;High\\-Quality&quot; Transaction Volume \\(Fees &amp; Activity\\)**\n\n1. Unlike &quot;PFP&quot; (Profile Picture) projects where activity dies after the mint, Ototentik is a High-Frequency State Machine.\n2. **The Mint:** Every car inspection generates a complex CIP-68 (Reference Token) transaction. This locks ~3 ADA in MinUTxO and generates higher transaction fees (~0.5 - 1.0 ADA) than standard txs due to the rich metadata payload (Arweave hashes).\n3. **The Lifecycle Updates \\(Recurring Revenue\\):** Vehicles are living assets. Every 6 months (service intervals) or upon resale, the metadata is updated. A fleet of 10,000 verified cars generates a constant stream of Metadata Update Transactions for years, creating a sustainable fee baseline for the network.\n4. **Data Usage:** We are not clogging the chain with JPEGs. We are storing hashes of real economic data, proving Cardano’s capability to handle high-throughput industrial IoT data.\n\n**B\\. Onboarding the &quot;Next Million&quot; \\(Wallet Growth\\)**\n\n1. Indonesia has 22 Million Crypto Investors (more than stock market investors), yet most only hold tokens on centralized exchanges (Indodax/Tokocrypto).\n2. **The Strategy:** Ototentik converts &quot;Passive Holders&quot; into &quot;Active Users.&quot; A car buyer scans a QR code and interacts with a wallet (Abstracted) without realizing it.\n3. **The Metric:** We project 300+ New Active Wallets in the pilot phase alone, with a pathway to 10,000+ wallets by Year 2. These are sticky users who rely on the wallet for their asset's value, not for speculation.\n\n**C\\. Establishing RWA Dominance \\(Narrative Win\\)**\n\n1. The crypto industry is pivoting to Real World Assets (RWA). By successfully tokenizing high-value verified vehicles (not just static real estate), Ototentik provides a live case study that Cardano is the #1 Chain for RWA.\n2. This gives the entire community &quot;Bragging Rights&quot; and marketing material to pitch Cardano to other enterprise clients (e.g., logistics, insurance) in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n# IMPACT ON THE NON-CARDANO COMMUNITY (The \"World\" Value)\n**A\\. Solving the $10 Billion \"Lemon Market\" \\(Economic Impact\\)** \n\n1. The Indonesian used car market is valued at $8.15 Billion (2025), but ~70% of vehicles suffer from odometer fraud.\n2. For Buyers: We protect the average Indonesian family from losing Rp 50 Million ($3,100) on a lemon car (e.g., a flood-damaged Avanza). This is often a family's life savings.\n3. For Sellers: Honest sellers currently suffer because buyers assume everyone is lying. Ototentik allows an honest seller to prove their car's value, commanding a fair price premium (approx. 5-10%) for a \"Verified Tokenized\" vehicle.\n\n\n\n**B\\. Consumer Protection & Safety \\(Social Impact\\)**\n\n1. Safety: A car with a rolled-back odometer might have missed critical timing belt changes, leading to engine failure at highway speeds. By exposing the true mileage, we directly improve road safety.\n2. Privacy (UU PDP Compliance): We are the first solution to respect the user's right to privacy using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Midnight). We show the Web2 world that blockchain isn't just about \"public transparency\" (which they hate); it's about \"selective disclosure\" (which they need).\n\n\n\n**C\\. The \"Web2\\.5\" Education \\(Educational Impact\\)**\n\nPT Inspeksi Mobil Jogja (our partner) is a traditional Web2 business. By integrating blockchain into their workflow seamlessly, we demonstrate to thousands of SMEs in Indonesia that Web3 is an infrastructure layer, not a casino.

STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP \\(OPERATIONAL FEASIBILITY\\)**\n\nWe are not building \"tech looking for a problem.\" We have a signed operational partnership with PT Inspeksi Mobil Jogja (IMJ).\n\n1. **Infrastructure Access:** We have immediate access to IMJ's garage, industrial OBD scanners, and a fleet of 15+ certified mechanical engineers who will serve as the \"Human Oracles\" for this project.\n2. **Real User Base:** We do not need to hunt for users. IMJ processes hundreds of cars monthly. We simply integrate Ototentik into their existing workflow.\n\n\n\n**3\\. ACADEMIC & SCIENTIFIC RIGOR \\(UGM BACKING\\)**\n\nOur code and architecture are supervised by active blockchain researchers from the Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Gadjah Mada.\n\n1. **Dr\\. Noor Akhmad Setiawan \\(PhD, UTP\\):** Provides rigorous security audits of our Smart Contracts.\n2. **Dr\\. Guntur Dharma Putra \\(PhD, UNSW\\):** A specialist in \"Blockchain-based Trust for IoT,\" ensuring our Phygital bridge (connecting physical cars to digital tokens) is theoretically sound and secure.\n\n\n\n**4\\. FINANCIAL & RISK MANAGEMENT**\n\n1. **Volatility Planning:** We have budgeted 175k ADA using a conservative \"Safe Rate\" ($0.50), ensuring we can complete the 8-month roadmap even if market conditions worsen.\n2. **Legal Compliance:** Our team includes operations and business support (Virna Amrita) to ensure all \"Midnight Privacy\" features comply with Indonesian Data Privacy Laws (UU PDP).","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Milestones","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Project Milestones","description":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":null,"title":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","description":"The number of milestones required depends on the amount of funding requested.

These represent years of innovation and investment to unlock real-world applications.\n\nHowever, despite their potential, these technologies remain largely unknown and underutilized. The issue is not their quality, but the lack of awareness and progressive education. In regions like Ecuador, most people are still unfamiliar with blockchain fundamentals, which prevents them from fully understanding or applying advanced Cardano solutions.\n\nCardano IdeaFest Ecuador is designed as the missing bridge to close this gap. The project will guide 100–150 participants through a step-by-step educational path:\n\nBlockchain basics → what blockchain is and why it matters.\n\nCardano ecosystem → why Cardano is unique and the opportunities it enables.\n\nReal-world applications → traceability, financial inclusion, identity, transparency.\n\nCardano Foundation &amp; IOG technologies → practical sessions on Originate, Veridian, Reeve, Hydra, and Midnight.\n\nThis progressive structure ensures that participants build a strong conceptual foundation before engaging with advanced tools and protocols.\n\nThe initiative culminates in a 2-day in-person ideathon in Quito. Instead of separate challenges, the ideathon will host a single inclusive challenge: “Innovating with Cardano.” Teams will choose one of five thematic tracks, each showcasing a specific technology:\n\n- **Traceability &amp; Supply Chains** → Originate\n- **Identity &amp; Inclusion** → Veridian Wallet\n- **Financial Transparency** → Reeve\n- **Scalability for Impact**→ Hydra\n- **Privacy &amp; Trust** → Midnight\n\nTo ensure inclusiveness and recognition:\n\n3 winning teams will receive main ADA prizes.\n\n\n\n**Post\\-event sustainability:** All materials, recordings, and generated ideas will be shared openly on GitHub under MIT/Apache 2.0 (code) and CC-BY 4.0 (educational content). The best ideas will be connected with developers, SPOs, and mentors to evolve into high-quality proposals for Catalyst Fund 15 - 16.

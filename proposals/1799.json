Its innovations are measurable and testable—for example, enabling direct comparison of several model positions per claim and creating timestamped, verifiable proofs on Cardano testnet or mainnet:**\n\n**1\\. Multi\\-agent reasoning with distinct “positions”**\n\nUnlike most AI systems that give a single verdict, MozAIc queries multiple AI models and preserves each model’s reasoning.

Our technical partner, Zaytrics, has delivered secure smart contracts, decentralized applications, and zero-knowledge proof systems across multiple L1 ecosystems, including Cardano. Their engineering team includes senior Haskell developers, backend architects, and AI/agent-orchestration specialists.\n\n \n\n**Feasibility of the Approach:**\n\n\n\nThe architecture is intentionally simple at its foundation: a minimal Plutus notary contract anchoring an off-chain reasoning bundle stored via IPFS/CID. The multi-agent comparison and version-preserved provenance layers operate entirely off-chain, eliminating cost and complexity while keeping the design modular and upgrade-ready. We validate feasibility through a working prototype built in incremental stages—first anchoring single-agent proofs, then extending to multi-agent bundles, and finally enabling version-preserved replay. Each stage includes functional tests, load tests, and reproducibility checks to ensure the system behaves predictably and auditably.\n\n\n\n**Verification & Testing:**\n\n\n\n– Multi-model consistency checks\n\n\n\n– CID retrieval and verification\n\n\n\n– Cross-version reasoning drift detection\n\n\n\n– On-chain anchor validation on Cardano testnet\n\n\n\n– Security review for data integrity and tamper resistance\n\n\n\nWe will publish results openly through GitHub commits, versioned test reports, and weekly build updates.\n\nWhy Reviewers Can Trust Delivery:\n\n\n\nThe scope of the Fund 15 prototype is deliberately right-sized. The on-chain component is a minimal Plutus notary contract—small, deterministic, and inexpensive to run—while all heavy computation and multi-model reasoning occur off-chain. As a result, the 12-month plan focuses on integration, testing, validation, and hardening rather than speculative R&D. This alignment keeps the project feasible, low-risk, and fully achievable within the requested budget and timeline.\n\n\n\nThe contract footprint is intentionally minimal and the off-chain architecture avoids expensive or experimental dependencies. The entire system is modular, open-source, and well-documented, allowing any Cardano-literate team to maintain or extend it.

Funds Locked Until Job Completion: An escrow system based on smart contracts that ensures the safety of money holding until the agreement of both parties that the job is done.\n3. Automated Payouts: The payment is released automatically by the system once the job is confirmed, thus eliminating the need for any third party intermediaries.\n4. Off chain Work Verification: The proofs of work (files, documents, or activities) can be verified outside the chain, and the results can be recorded on the chain for transparency and integrity.\n5. On chain Talent Score: A reputation system that is transparent and could not be altered is stored on-chain to avoid manipulation and provide reliable evaluations.\n6. Peer to Peer (P2P) Chat: Directly encrypted messaging between peers that workers and employers use to talk without depending on centralized servers.\n7.

Our history in the Cardano Indonesia ecosystem, together with technical know-how in system design and project management, gives us a firm ground to execute this project with great levels of trust and accountability.\n\nEvery development activity will be done in a transparent manner through constant updates, full documentation, and open-source code on GitHub. With our combined power and participation of Tutut Indah and friends, we agreed to have an agreement and compiled our ideas beneath the Cardano Hub Indonesia and a perspective of financial feasibility from Fanny Wijaya as Cardano Ambassador Indonesia.\n\nThe Financial Viability will engage a sustained revenue model of ROI, capital required from business owners rather than workforce to add more cost just to get a job. Fanny Wijaya has engaged several times meeting with Tutut in the arena of Cardano Woman Indonesia, achieving standards of Woman Empowerment in Indonesia and agreed to proceed with the initiatives. The insight was: Ambassadors often present projects to come to their monthly meeting, foresee the potential project that is suitable for the community. In 2 months, this proposal was successfully made.\n\nTransparency and financial feasibility will be added to the milestone as an output and milestone based, to ensure that our approach here is monitored:\n\n1. Development of a usable MVP for conducting tests on main flows like identity verification, job posting, on-chain escrow, and job completion.\n2. Community testing through a testnet and early-access onboarding of Cardano Hub Indonesia and global ecosystem participants.\n3. Technical evaluation of Atala Prism DID integration and the reliability of on-chain/off-chain procedures prior to the mainnet launch.\n4. Market confirmation by measuring user interest, collecting usability feedback, and defining real-world feature requirements from both professional and non-cryptocurrency user segments.\n\nMoreover, transparency and financial viability will be part of the milestone-based outputs, which will ensure that every milestone will provide a comprehensive report on fund utilization, verified technical progress, and cost-effectiveness assessment. This framework guarantees the entire project timeline will have continuous monitoring and accountability.\n\n**Past achievement with core team of Cardano Hub Indonesia:**\n\n1.

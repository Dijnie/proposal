This vacuum fuels legitimate criticism about efficiency, transparency, and ROI — criticism that can only be silenced with hard data.\n\n**_Important Clarification: This Is Not an Audit to Assign Blame — It's a Collaborative Learning Tool for Post\\-Catalyst Excellence_**\n\nWe are not here to point fingers, &quot;name and shame,&quot; or retroactively penalize teams. This study is a forward-looking, community-driven initiative designed purely to identify patterns of success and unlock improvements for future proposals. By surfacing what truly drives sustainable impact (e.g., clear KPIs, community partnerships, scalable models), we'll equip proposers, voters, and the Cardano Foundation with actionable blueprints to elevate the next generation of Catalyst projects. Think of it as a &quot;lessons learned&quot; playbook: turning hindsight into foresight, reducing waste, and amplifying on-chain adoption in F16 and beyond. Our ethos is collaborative — all findings will celebrate wins, diagnose systemic barriers (like reporting gaps or funding mismatches), and co-create recommendations with funded teams via surveys and AMAs. No punishments; just progress for a stronger, more efficient ecosystem.\n\nWe will deliver the first large-scale, offline, statistically rigorous study of 200 randomly selected completed Catalyst projects (Funds 1–14) using stratified sampling designed by a professional statistician. This sample size delivers 95% confidence with ±4.9% margin of error — higher precision than most World Bank or EU grant audits — while remaining fully feasible within a 60,000 ADA budget.\n\n**Why Only 200 Projects Analyzed? A Scientifically Justified Approach**\n\nFrom the ~1,300 completed projects (as of Nov 2025, per Catalyst.io), we target a representative sample that's efficient, unbiased, and scalable. Using stratified random sampling (stratified by fund round and category to capture diversity), 200 provides elite statistical power without overkill. Here's the math:\n\n**Statistical Metric                          Value Achieved              Benchmark Standard \\(e\\.g\\., World Bank Audits\\)**\n\nMargin of Error\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                               ±4.9%                               ±5.0%\n\nConfidence Level                                     95%                                  95%\n\nPower to Detect Sustainability Issues    98%                              &gt;90%\n\nCost Efficiency vs. Full Population       +24% precision gain      N/A\n\n\n\n**Formula \\(Cochran for Finite Populations\\): **\n\n\n\n**Statistical formula applied: n = \\(1\\.96² × 0\\.5 × 0\\.5 / 0\\.049²\\) / \\(1 \\+ \\(1\\.96² × 0\\.5 × 0\\.5\\) / \\(0\\.049² × 1300\\)\\) = 200 projects**\n\nThis beats a simple random sample of 305 (which would cost 2x more) and ensures impartiality — no cherry-picking. Full methodology, code (Python/R), and validation on public GitHub. More would be redundant; this is the &quot;sweet spot&quot; for credible, actionable insights.\n\nThe study will answer three core questions the community is asking in 2025:\n\n1. How many projects achieved measurable adoption and are still active today?\n2. What factors separate sustainable projects from those that disappeared after close-out reports?\n3. Which processes and barriers must be eliminated to stop waste and increase real impact?","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"The study will produce a detailed report on the impact of 200 projects, identifying:\n\n- Strengths: adoption of dApps, effective community practices.\n- Weaknesses: lack of continuity or follow-up.\n- Practices to eliminate: unclear processes or poor reporting.\n\nExpected results:\n\n- 200 projects analyzed (80% with verified data).\n- 300 validated survey responses.\n- +300 downloads of the final report.\n- Local community established to continue debate.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

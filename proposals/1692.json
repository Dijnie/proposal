Unlike cars, which are tracked by a VIN from factory to scrapyard, bicycles become “invisible” once they leave production.\n\nThis fragmentation creates inefficiencies and lost opportunities for every stakeholder:\n\nThe result is millions of stolen bikes with recovery rates below 10%, fragmented revenue streams, and depressed second-hand values due to unverifiable authenticity and history.\n\nThe BikeID Solution and The Bicycle Identification Number (BIN)\n\nBikeID creates a secure, permanent, universal digital identity for every bicycle using high grade imbedded NFC tags.\n\nOur key innovation enabling the scaling and rollout of the system are our proprietary, ultra-thin BikeID tags combined Bicycle Identification Number creating a digital identity for each bicycle.\n\n**Each bike receives:**\n\n- globally unique, 24-character Bicycle Identification Number (BIN)\n- tamper-proof RFID/NFC tag secured on the bicycle frame\n- globally supported Proof of Ownership NFC card\n- BIN Cloud with bike lifecycle event, ownership and history record securely stored with Proof of Bike\n\n**Benefits and Opportunities for Stakeholders**\n\n1. **Riders**\n\nAt its core, BikeID benefits the rider: global Proof of Ownership, stronger theft protection, higher resale value, and access to services like insurance, financing, and maintenance reminders. Activation is simple via BikeID NFC tag or BikeID card. Transfer of ownership is super easy and reporting bicycle theft with a single click informs the local police.\n\nStandalone BikeID Kits containing BikeID tag and card, are now available in cycling stores and Allegro. This is a strong value proposition for cyclists to secure their bicycle but also a big opportunity for brands and retailers to tap into additional revenue sources and give customer retention a real boost.\n\n1. **Manufacturers**\n\nBikeID integrates with factory ERP and PIM systems, delivering real-time traceability and full visibility across the value chain. It streamlines stock financing, prevents warranty fraud, and opens new revenue streams through direct customer engagement.\n\nExample - Romet: Poland’s largest manufacturer (500k+ bikes/year) is integrating BikeID and BIN registration at the factory to register every bike in real time.\n\n1. **Brands**\n\nBikeID bridges the gap between brands and riders. It enables authenticity for high-end builds, direct recalls, and lifecycle services like extended warranties, captive finance and service plans.\n\nExample - Loca Bikes: Premium custom bikes with a permanent digital passport, supporting luxury collaborations, digital certificates and NFTs.\n\n1. **Retailers**\n\nBikeID automates operations from warehouse check-in to sales and allows retailers to offer bundled, additional high margin services. Every transaction becomes digitally connected, allowing retailers to drive retention with service reminders, upsells, and ongoing engagement. Based on our calculations, a universal BikeID can add on average €200 to every bike over the bicycle lifecycle.\n\n_Example - Centrum Rowerowe: Launching BIN in 2026 to turn high-volume sales into lasting relationships _\n\n**Technical On\\-Chain Solution**\n\nTechnical Approach\n\nOur hybrid implementation model provides a scalable, efficient and financially viable solution\n\n**Charli3's Cardano Partnerchain** offers the perfect mix of economic viability and Merkle Tree framework for large data sets. All Trees anchor cryptographic proofs in unique leafs on the Partnerchain that can be pushed to Cardano main-net if needed. On-chain proofs enable ownership, non-membership (critical for logistics), and deletion (eg. recycling)\n\n- Proof of Bike and Ownership,\n- Detailed bike and lifecycle data is stored off-chain in secure databases\n- Events &amp; ownership data (Iagon decentralized storage)\n\nPublic bicycle data (eg. specifications, theft reports)\n\nBIN registration is free; paid “events” (ownership transfers, service updates) cost €0.25 each\n\n1. **Proof of Bike; Proof of Ownership \\(on\\-chain\\)**\n\nAt the core of BIN is Proof of Bike, a cryptographic certificate that links a physical bicycle to its unique digital identity. This record, anchored directly to Charli3's Cardano Partnerchain, which cannot be altered or forged serves as immutable Proof of Ownership, giving riders confidence their bike is verifiable anywhere in the world.\n\nFor manufacturers, insurers, and police, this on-chain proof provides a trusted foundation to combat theft, fraud, and counterfeit claims at a manageable and stable price.\n\n\n\n**2\\. Middleware solution** for data integration on chain and long term privatized storage of Proof of Bike.\n\nThis layer will read from the PostgreSQL database with all data categories for storage. BIKEID gathers this data from manufactureres and users. This middleware solution will produce an API allowing data to flow outwards to the blockchain and privatized storage. \n\n\n\n**3\\. Events &amp; Ownership Data \\(iagon decentralized storage\\)**\n\nBeyond ownership, a bicycle generates a series of events throughout its lifecycle\n\n-sales\n\n-transfers\n\n-service records, and upgrades.\n\nThese are dynamic data points, valuable for retailers, brands, and riders, that don’t require the cost or permanence of being fully on-chain. Each event is linked back to the bike’s BIN, creating a transparent and auditable history while keeping costs low and performance high.\n\nBIN uses Iagon decentralized cloud storage to handle dynamic ownership and event data because it combines security, resilience, and compliance at enterprise scale. Unlike centralized servers, Iagon distributes encrypted data fragments across a decentralized network, eliminating single points of failure and ensuring survivability even if parts of the network go offline. This architecture guarantees high availability, tamper-resistance, and GDPR-compliant data handling, making it ideal for sensitive yet evolving records like transfers, service logs, and warranty updates. For BIN, Iagon provides the balance of trust, performance, and cost-efficiency needed to support millions of bikes worldwide.\n\n**4\\. Public Bicycle Data \\(BIN Cloud\\) with Charli3 Partnerchain**\n\nCertain data needs to be fast, dynamic, accessible, and widely available on a public ledger:\n\n- model specifications,\n- production details,\n- warranty status,\n- and other non-sensitive attributes.\n\nBikeID manages this through a PostgreSQL database, powering public queries from retailers, marketplaces, or even police databases. Each Merkle Tree leaf on Charli3 is a unique BikeID, holding all publically required data, and keeping Iagon private data seperate.\n\nThis ensures instant access to validated information without exposing sensitive ownership records. By separating public data from personal data, BIN achieves both speed and compliance, balancing blockchain transparency for the industry with privacy for the rider.\n\nThis design keeps costs minimal, ensures GDPR compliance, and supports millions of bikes. For premium builds, a full NFT-based “super BikeID” remains an option.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"BikeID becomes a global, real-world application showcasing blockchain’s power at scale.\n\n**\\*\\*One bike\\. One record\\. Everywhere\\. Powered by Cardano Tech\\. \\*\\***\n\nBikeID creates one of the first large-scale, real-world applications of blockchain product identity\n\nBy anchoring millions of bicycles through Blockchain technology, we bring visibility, adoption, and credibility to the Cardano network. Every Proof of Bike record is a live demonstration of Cardano tech immutability, scalability, and sustainability. For the community, this proves Cardano is not only for finance but also for solving tangible, global problems.\n\n**Cardano SPOs will be the main beneficiary of this operation\\.** Their involvement with Charli3's partnerchain infrastructure will manage all off-chain data reads from BikeID's platform and validate them on-chain, with a further _root hash on Cardano main net, creating transaction attestations and transaction volume on Cardano_. Additionally, partnering with large global bicycle manufacturers has a multiplier effect. Each integration instantly brings hundreds of thousands of new BikeIDs on chain every year, creating one of the largest real-world identity use cases on any blockchain. Manufacturers act as on-ramps, embedding BikeID directly into production, which accelerates adoption at scale without requiring riders to be crypto-native. This not only drives millions of on-chain Proof of Ownership records but also positions Cardano as the backbone of a trusted global standard, visible in showrooms and factories worldwide.\n\nBikeID has gained a lot of interest from financial institutions, mainly from banks and insurance companies who are looking to roll out similar level of services in cycling as they are currently provided to the automotive, but without a globally unique asset ID are unable to provide. This can easily form a snowball effect of digital financial services centred around Cardano-based cycling ecosystem.\n\nWe are working very closely with industry bodies such as CONEBI and CIE. These institutions represent hundreds of brands, distributors, and retailers across Europe and globally. By aligning Bicycle Identification Number with their policy and standardization efforts, we move from single-company adoption to industry-wide adoption. This institutional backing helps establish BIN as the de facto identity standard for bicycles, similar to how VIN is mandated in the automotive sector. **For Cardano, it means blockchain becomes embedded at the regulatory and policy level**, ensuring long-term adoption, credibility, and integration into insurance, mobility, and sustainability frameworks.\n\n**To measure the impact we will track both adoption and engagement metrics to demonstrate the Cardano Partnerchain utility at scale**\n\n- Number of bikes registered on-chain (factory-level integrations and retail activations)\n- Number of Proof of Ownership verifications executed on-chain\n- Percentage of theft recovery cases linked to BIN records\n- Growth in partner integrations (manufacturers, retailers, insurers)\n\n**Results will be openly shared with the Cardano community through**\n\n- Regular progress reports and dashboards showing live adoption metrics\n- Open APIs and documentation for developers to build new services (insurance, marketplaces, financing) on top of BIN\n- Case studies with manufacturers, retailers, and riders to highlight Cardano’s role\n- Presentations at Cardano events, demonstrating how blockchain-backed identity is solving theft, fraud, and data fragmentation\n\nBikeID will showcase Cardano created tech as the backbone of a trusted global product identity system, delivering adoption, data, and real-world impact the community can measure and build upon.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

The team has delivered 11/11 Catalyst-funded projects with evidence-based reporting, passed multiple third-party audits (CertiK, Anastasia Labs), and launched Cardano’s first decentralized oracle network in October 2022, which has operated with 100% ecosystem uptime. Beyond mainnet oracles, Charli3 has already implemented a functioning partnerchain oracle MVP in Substrate posting data directly to Cardano, demonstrating full-stack capability across Haskell/Plutus, Rust/Substrate, cross-chain integrations (EVM, Polkadot, upcoming Cardano chains like Midnight), and on-chain governance and incentives. The next step is to evolve this from a team-operated MVP into a community-governed, open-source oracle marketplace that any Cardano project can use, extend, and scale.\n\n\n\nBIKEID complements this with 25+ years of hands-on experience in the automotive and mobility sectors, including building dealer management systems, mobility platforms, and AI solutions for global brands such as Hyundai, Mercedes Benz, and Volkswagen. The team is deeply familiar with complex manufacturing, retail, and aftersales processes, and has already validated the technical design with manufacturers and retailers, with pilots being prepared for Romet, Ecobike, and Centrum Rowerowe. BIN’s developers bring strong Cardano and enterprise integration expertise (smart contracts, identity, IPFS, Hydra, ERP/MES, PIM, DMS) and are backed by established governance processes, clear KPIs, and transparent fund management.\n\nBIKEID also is the 2025 Cardano Summit Battle of the Builders Champion - showcasing their understanding of business and blockchain implementation. \n\n\n\nIn combination, Charli3 provides robust, audited, production-ready oracle infrastructure and Cardano ecosystem credibility, while BIN ensures real-world adoption through industry partnerships, stepwise pilots, measurable KPIs, and open dashboards and APIs.

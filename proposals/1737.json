Even the most popular ones have very little liquidity, and users who swap across chains to Cardano receive significantly less crypto than they spend as a result.\n- **Pain point:** a lack of liquidity on protocols reduces your portfolio’s value when you swap assets across chains to Cardano.\n\n\n\n**Lack of hardware wallet support**\n\n- Hardware wallet users cannot easily swap assets to and from Cardano; end-to-end support for hardware wallets is hard to guarantee as it requires wallets on different chains to support the same device and, importantly, a protocol supporting these wallets.\n- **Pain point**: a user’s wallets on different chains do not always support the same hardware wallets and, if they do, a protocol may not support the wallets themselves.\n\n\n\n**Centralized options aren’t secure**\n\n- There are many centralized exchanges that support swapping assets to and from Cardano; however, centralized exchanges require a user to create an account (which may not be possible based on a user’s location) and share personal details through KYC procedures. A centralized exchange can prevent a user from withdrawing funds from the exchange under the guise of anti-money laundering (AML) or fraud prevention.\n- **Pain point**: centralized exchanges don’t give you full control over your funds and require you to share personal information (that could link your real-world identity with your crypto activities).\n\n\n\n# NUFI’s solution:\n**Non\\-custodial cross\\-chain swaps with aggregated liquidity, broad hardware wallet support, and multi\\-chain wallet consolidation**\n\n\n\nNUFI’s proposal has two parts:\n\n1. integrate SwapKit/NEAR Intents into NUFI wallet to provide cross-chain swap functionality; and\n2. enable multi-seed phrase/private key import so that Cardano users can restore their existing Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum/EVM, Solana and other wallets into one single wallet interface and swap assets across chains seamlessly.\n\n\n\n# Part 1: SwapKit/NEAR Intents integration\n\n\nIntegrating SwapKit/NEAR Intents into NUFI’s non-custodial wallet interface will allow users to swap thousands of assets to/from ADA in an easy, non-custodial, and cost-efficient way.\n\n\n\n**Cardano users will be able to:**\n\n\n\n- Restore multiple existing wallets (for Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, all EVM chains, Solana and SVM chains) into a single non-custodial wallet interface\n- Swap thousands of assets to/from ADA – including BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, USDT, USDC – with a couple of clicks (and in one transaction)\n- Swap assets at the best rates: SwapKit aggregates cross-chain protocols and DEXes to find the best rates for each swap (furthermore, a user will be able to choose the swap’s route or use a fallback exchange, powered by Changelly, if liquidity is too low or a given pair is unavailable)\n- Have orders fulfilled without losing value (thanks to the aggregated liquidity that SwapKit/NEAR Intents unlocks)\n- Swap assets using a hardware wallet: Ledger, Trezor, Keystone, BitBox02, OneKey, and GridPlus devices supported\n- Swap with no KYC or signup needed\n- View swap history in NUFI’s interface\n- Swap bridged assets for Cardano tokens using NUFI’s existing Cardano DEX aggregator (powered by DexHunter)\n\n\n\n**The proposed SwapKit integration can be used with existing \\(non\\-NUFI\\) wallets thanks to…**\n\n# Part 2: Multi-seed phrase/private key import\n\n\nThis functionality allows a user to combine multiple seed phrases/private keys into a single wallet in NUFI’s interface.\n\n\n\n**With this, a user will be able to:**\n\n\n\n- restore their Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, EVM, Solana and SVM wallets into a single wallet interface to make assets easily available for use with the SwapKit solution\n- move liquidity from ‘my BTC wallet’ to ‘my ADA wallet’ with a couple of clicks\n- into the same wallet, add hardware wallet accounts; Ledger, Trezor, Keystone, BitBox02, OneKey and GridPlus devices supported. Please see [https://nu\\.fi/chains/support](https://nu.fi/chains/support) for more information\n\n\n\n**Supported seed phrases types**: 12, 15, and 24-word BIP-39 mnemonics\n\n**Supported private key type**: cardano-cli .skey format\n\n\n\n**FAQs**\n\nQ: If I restore my wallet into NUFI, does it change my existing wallet setup?\n\nA: No; you can restore your wallet into an unlimited number of wallet interfaces and use all interfaces at the same time without changing your wallet’s setup. You’ll see the same assets/accounts in each interface.\n\n\n\nQ: Can I remove a seed phrase or private key from my wallet after importing it?\n\nA: Yes, you’ll be able to remove a seed phrase or private key after importing it, which will remove the associated accounts/assets from your wallet.\n\n\n\n**About SwapKit**\n\nSwapKit is a multi-chain swap and DeFi SDK/aggregator that lets apps and wallets perform cross-chain token swaps, bridging, and DEX trades through a single interface.\n\n\n\nSwapKit integrates major decentralized non-custodial cross chain protocols such as ThorChain, Chainflip, Maya Protocol and NEAR Intents on 30+ major chains. It also aggregates 12 on-chain DEXes. Therefore, SwapKit is able to find a route for almost any token to any token. SwapKit does not support Cardano yet (although it is supported on NEAR Intents and should be supported on Maya Protocol later this year) but it should add Cardano support soon.\n\n\n\nIf SwapKit won’t add Cardano support in time, we will integrate Near Intents (which supports Cardano already) and add SwapKit support on top of it once available (as SwapKit support will enable advanced routing also through DEXes, including eventually a Cardano DEX).","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"**SwapKit/NEAR Intents integration:**\n\n- Will open up deep-liquidity routes for users who want to move funds in and out of Cardano; Cardano users will benefit from being able to swap to ADA from other chains without suffering significant loss due to low liquidity\n- Will enable Cardano users to trade thousands of assets on other chains for ADA in a single interface (i.e. without needing to use multiple protocols with multiple wallets, and without needing to pay multiple transaction fees); hardware wallet users will also benefit from the extensive HW support that this solution offers\n\n\n\n**Multi\\-seed phrase/private key import:**\n\n- Will enable users to consolidate wallets on multiple chains into one single wallet interface so that assets can be swapped across chains seamlessly","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

encourages users to bring liquidity into Cardano’s ecosystem: at present, the low liquidity (and resulting loss of value) and poor UX of existing cross-chain swap solutions deter users from swapping to ADA from other chains\n- It is significantly cheaper than boosting liquidity on existing solutions, or overhauling their UX to make them viable solutions, and significantly less than a cross-chain DEX would require for integrating Cardano

Viet Nam overview: **\n\nVietnam is emerging as one of Asia’s growing hubs for blockchain talent, creating strong potential for Web3 development. However, the shortage of developers and the lack of a high-quality DeFi/FinTech project pipeline remain key challenges that must be addressed for Cardano to fully capture this opportunity and expand its ecosystem utility and market presence.\n\nAcross Asia, the developer base is expanding rapidly. The 2024 Electric Capital Developer Report finds Asia now leads the world by share of crypto developers, with 41% newcomers entering Web3 in 2024.\n\n![](https://cdn.hstatic.net/files/200001096509/file/screenshot_2025-11-25_145323.png)\n\nSource: The 2024 Electric Capital Developer Report\n\nVietnam has emerged as a Southeast Asian tech hub with around 560,000 professionals in computer science and IT-related sectors and 55,000–60,000 students enrolling in IT majors each year.\n\nOn the demand side, Vietnam exhibits persistently high user adoption of crypto. Chainalysis’s 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index places Vietnam in the top five worldwide, indicating a deep base of motivated users and prospective builders who can be activated through localized onboarding and Vietnamese-language materials.\n\n![](https://cdn.hstatic.net/files/200001096509/file/screenshot_2025-11-25_145545.png)\n\nSource: The 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index - Chainalysis\n\nOn the Cardano ecosystem side, Cardano’s developer base remains active and growing, open-source activity across crypto is at an all-time high: the Electric Capital “Monthly commits” series shows a multi-year uptrend with a new peak approaching 30k commits/month in 2025 - evidence of expanding supply on the builder side.\n\n![](https://cdn.hstatic.net/files/200001096509/file/screenshot_2025-11-25_150039.png)\n\nSource: Developer Report by Electric Capital\n\n\n\n**2\\. Problem Statement:**\n\nThe core challenge facing the Cardano community in Vietnam is the critical shortage of skilled core developers and a limited pipeline of high-potential DeFi/FinTech projects. This deficiency severely constrains market share and essential ecosystem utility.\n\n- Developer Gap: Despite Vietnam's vast pool of general technical engineers, the number of Cardano Developers formally trained in Plutus/Marlowe is currently very low. This creates a significant barrier to building complex, core applications on Cardano, limiting market competitiveness and ecosystem utility. \n- The Product and Utility Gap: The talent shortage results in an ineffective project pipeline for high-quality DeFi/FinTech products (such as payment, privacy, and Perpetual DEX solutions). This prevents Cardano from capturing significant market share in one of Asia's fastest-growing consumer and technology markets.\n\n\n\n**3\\. Solution: THE AIBI \\(AWARENESS \\- IDEATION \\- BUILDING \\- INCUBATION\\) STRATEGY**\n\n\n\nWe propose a comprehensive, 6-month, structured ecosystem development strategy called the AIBI Pipeline (Awareness-Ideation-Building-Incubation). This strategy is specifically designed to convert Vietnam's vast technical talent into high-quality Cardano builders, directly addressing the critical shortage of skilled developers and viable DeFi projects.\n\n\n\nThis structured approach directly solves the two core problems identified above:\n\n![](https://cdn.hstatic.net/files/200001096509/file/screenshot_2025-11-25_150128.png)\n\n\n\n**4\\. Strategic Framework:**\n\n- Incubation Program & Follow-up Support: Offer working space,  funds, marketing and promotion, networking and mentor guidance ensuring teams can develop sustainable prototypes and advance toward hackathon.\n- Awareness & Education (Months 1-2): Launch targeted workshops for university students covering Cardano 101, Plutus, and Marlowe, with the goal of building a strong foundational knowledge base for future developers and blockchain builders.\n- Ideation & Building Catalyst (Months 3-4): Initiate a Cardano Ideathon followed by the centerpiece event: the Cardano Hackathon (2-3 days). This will act as a funnel to drive 25+ teams centered on high-demand areas: payment, privacy, and DeFi on Cardano.\n- Hackathon kick-off and Technical Bootcamp (Month 5): Run Cardano Hackathon by utilizing the combined hybrid model for maximum reach and focused development, supported by intensive mentorship from Core Developers and Cardano. Focus on 25+ high-potential projects. \n- Demo Day and Report: Select and support the most promising teams for Demo Days. Do an overall report and Community impact video with activity results summary and metrics: number of participants, ideas generated, pilot projects, and video recap.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"This initiative creates positive impacts that extend far beyond the Vietnamese market, establishing a framework for institutional adoption globally.\n\n- **Talent Pipeline &** IP Generation: Directly yields 20-30 new Cardano-skilled developers and seeds the ecosystem with 2-3 commercially viable DeFi/FinTech applications, enhancing the global technical repository.\n- Adoption and Utility Validation: The successful onboarding of 500+ new users provides verifiable, on-chain proof of Cardano's real-world utility and adoption within a high-growth consumer market.\n- Strategic Market Access: Establishing a strong presence in the Da Nang tech hub positions Cardano to engage with favorable regulatory environments (sandbox), creating templates for regulatory navigation applicable to other developed economies.\n- Knowledge Transfer & Open Source IP: All successful methodologies, training materials, and implementation processes will be documented and released as open-source playbooks, allowing other global communities to replicate the successful growth model.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

Our cost-effectiveness is validated by our proven execution history and a robust co-investment model, resulting in sustainable growth and high ROI metrics.\n\n\n\n**1\\. Strategic Co\\-Investment and Long\\-Term Commitment**\n\nOur commitment ensures this project is a true community co-funding initiative, not a standalone grant request:\n\n- Internal Financial Dedication: SCI Labs maintains high, ongoing operational costs, including salaries and core community activities, estimated at $100,000 USD annually. This requested Cardano fund supplements these existing long-term investments, specifically targeting the high-leverage, scalable activities (Hackathon, Dev Training, Da Nang outreach) that require immediate capital injection.\n- Shared Ecosystem Responsibility: By requesting this fund, SCI Labs seeks to partner with the Cardano community to share the financial responsibility for key ecosystem growth. We are committing our existing $100k annual operational budget and our $100k incubation fund to the long-term success of the projects, asking the Cardano community to contribute only the necessary capital to scale the activation events.\n- Financial Multiplier: By focusing on event logistics and builder incentives, SCI Labs ensures that every ADA contributed is amplified through SCI Labs’ existing annual operational budget. This approach delivers returns far greater than what a fully self-funded project could achieve.\n\n\n\n**2\\. Strategic Market Access and Sustainable Growth**\n\nThe project ensures the funds deliver long-term, strategic value by anchoring Cardano in a crucial market:\n\n- Cardano Market Anchor in Vietnam: With SCI Labs community network ( and a stable $100k annual operational base, we provide Cardano with an immediate and scalable presence in one of Asia’s fastest-growing tech ecosystems.\n- Strategic Positioning in Da Nang: By operating in Da Nang—an emerging sandbox for digital and regulatory innovation—we secure a first-mover advantage and produce replicable frameworks for enterprise adoption and government alignment across the wider region.\n- Reusable Open-Source Playbooks: All event processes and methodologies will be published as open-source assets, empowering Cardano communities worldwide to replicate successful growth models and accelerate ecosystem expansion efficiently.\n\n\n\nConclusion: The 60,000 ADA investment is more than event funding—it is a high-impact strategic partnership. It enables the Cardano community to amplify SCI Labs’ proven pipeline, unlocking significant returns in builder talent, real products, and long-term market positioning.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal is a non-technical initiative, with ≤20% of the budget for tech support.","description":"Scope Fit:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal provides verifiable evidence (portfolio, links, reports) of the team's ability to deliver the project.","description":"Relevant Experience:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes clear objectives with both Output Metrics (what proposal did) and Adoption-Focused Metrics (what effect proposal had).","description":"Clear Goals & KPIs:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly explains the user journey and provides a credible plan for how the project will equip and motivate users for future on-chain activity.","description":"Pathway to Adoption:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the initiative clearly demonstrates how it will grow the Cardano ecosystem or onboard users.","description":"Community Value:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the project plan and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic and well-defined.","description":"Realistic Timeline:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal commits to public outputs and justifies any exceptions.","description":"Public Outputs:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget adheres to all policies: it is for future work, follows the merchandise rule, and excludes establishing local treasuries, incentives/giveaways, re-grants.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

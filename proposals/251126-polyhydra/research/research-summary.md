# Polyhydra Research Summary

**Research Date:** 2025-11-26
**Proposal Concept:** Monopoly-style game on Cardano using Hydra protocol

## Key Findings Overview

### 1. Technical Feasibility: HIGH ✅

**Hydra Protocol Status:**
- Production-ready v1.0.0 (Oct 2025)
- ~1,000 TPS per head, <1s latency
- Isomorphic design = same Plutus scripts work
- Proven: Hydra Doom achieved 807K TPS

**Perfect Fit for Board Games:**
- Turn-based = ideal for state channels
- 2-8 players = matches head model
- Session-based = clean open/close cycle
- Near-zero transaction fees

### 2. Competitive Landscape: FAVORABLE ✅

**Direct Competition: Minimal**
- Maya (BSC): Only comparable, server-dependent
- Ape-Opoly: Physical only, not blockchain-native
- **NO Monopoly game on Cardano**
- **NO board game using Hydra anywhere**

**Differentiation Opportunities:**
- First Hydra-powered game
- True on-chain game state
- Zero-fee transactions
- Dynamic CIP-68 NFTs

### 3. Ecosystem Gap: SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY ✅

**What Exists:**
- Metaverses (Cornucopias, Pavia)
- Action games (racing, shooters)
- Card games (Cardania)

**What's Missing:**
- Board/casual games
- Hydra production applications
- Turn-based strategy games
- Low-barrier entry games

### 4. Fund15 Alignment: STRONG ✅

**Best Category:** Cardano Use Cases (15K-200K ADA)
- Prototype/MVP requirement fits
- On-chain metrics focus aligns
- Technical innovation valued

**Key Requirements:**
- 2-12 month timeline
- 2-6 milestones (based on budget)
- Verifiable team credentials
- Max 2 proposals per participant

## Viability Assessment

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Technical Feasibility | 4/5 | Hydra ready, complexity manageable |
| Market Opportunity | 5/5 | No direct competition, clear gap |
| Ecosystem Fit | 5/5 | Aligns with Cardano gaming growth |
| Fund15 Alignment | 4/5 | Perfect for Use Cases category |
| Innovation Score | 5/5 | First Hydra game, CIP-68 NFTs |
| **Overall** | **4.6/5** | **Strong proposal candidate** |

## Recommended Approach

### Unique Value Proposition
> "Polyhydra: The first blockchain board game powered by Hydra state channels, enabling true peer-to-peer Monopoly-style gameplay with provably fair mechanics and zero transaction fees on Cardano."

### Key Innovation Points
1. **First Hydra-powered game** - Novel L2 application
2. **True on-chain game state** - Verifiable, trustless
3. **Dynamic property NFTs** - CIP-68 evolving assets
4. **Zero-fee gameplay** - Hydra eliminates gas concerns
5. **Accessible entry** - Free-to-play option

### Suggested Budget Range
- **Conservative:** 75,000-100,000 ADA (~$31K-42K)
- **Full Scope:** 150,000-200,000 ADA (~$63K-84K)

### Timeline Recommendation
- 9-12 months for full MVP
- Phased milestones with playable alpha at month 4-5

## Risk Summary

| Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| Hydra complexity | Medium | SDK usage, phased approach |
| User adoption | Medium | Free-to-play, familiar game |
| Regulatory (P2E) | Low | Optional token rewards |
| Team capacity | Variable | Verify before submission |

## Unresolved Questions

1. Team composition and credentials to include?
2. Exact tokenomics model preference?
3. Free-to-play vs mandatory NFT ownership?
4. Partnership strategy with existing Cardano gaming projects?
5. Target user acquisition channels?

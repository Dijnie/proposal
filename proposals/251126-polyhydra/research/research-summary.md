- Discord monthly active gamers: 200M+
- GameFi market 2032: $121B projected
- Cardano ecosystem: 4M+ wallets

**First-Mover Advantages**
- First Cardano Discord Activity
- First production Hydra GameFi
- Reference implementation for ecosystem

### 4. Impact Potential: MEASURABLE

**Target KPIs (6 months)**
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Discord Installs | 10,000 |
| Monthly Active Players | 5,000 |

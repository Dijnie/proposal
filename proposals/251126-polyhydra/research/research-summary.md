## Key Research Findings

### Technical Feasibility: ✅ VALIDATED

1. **Hydra 1.0.0** (Oct 2025) production-ready with real ADA support
2. **Hydra Doom** proved 86M+ transactions, 4,000 TPS peak
3. **Turn-based ideal** for state channels: 2-6 players per head optimal
4. **Commit-reveal** scheme sufficient for provably fair (no oracle needed)
5. **Cost:** ~0.17 ADA per game vs 1-2 ADA per turn on L1

### Market Opportunity: ✅ STRONG

1. **Zero Hydra consumer games** currently live → first-mover advantage
2. **Discord Activities** growing but no Cardano integration
3. **Board games** proven mass appeal; Monopoly-style accessible
4. **Web2 onboarding friction** = major ecosystem bottleneck
5. **DAO community tools** gap for engagement activities

### Competitive Position: ✅ DIFFERENTIATED

| Differentiator | Polyhydra Advantage |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Hydra-powered | Only game using Hydra for consumer play |
| Discord-native | No wallet required to start |
| Social gaming | Friends play together in voice channels |
| Provably Fair | Verifiable randomness with on-chain proof |
| Casual format | Low learning curve vs complex MMORPGs |

### Team Assessment: ✅ CAPABLE

- **5+ Catalyst projects** delivered (Fund 10, 11, 12, 13)
- **Full-stack capability:** React + Aiken + Hydra + DevOps
- **Community access:** 500+ Cardano2VN, 2,000+ Discord gamers
- **Hydra pioneers:** Among few teams actively building on Hydra

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| Discord policy change | 🟡 Medium | Web fallback version |
| Hydra bugs at scale | 🟡 Medium | Stress testing + snapshots |
| Low initial adoption | 🟠 High | Leverage existing communities |
| L1 fee volatility | 🟢 Low | Batch settlement off-peak |
| Wallet onboarding drop-off | 🟢 Low | Wallet optional until rewards |

## Scoring Prediction (1-5 Stars)

| Criteria | Expected | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Impact** | ★★★★☆ (4) | Validates Hydra, expands user base, but niche gaming |
| **Feasibility** | ★★★★★ (5) | Proven team, clear tech path, realistic timeline |
| **Value for Money** | ★★★★☆ (4) | 50-100K ADA for production game is competitive |

**Overall:** Strong candidate for funding

## Unresolved Questions

### Technical
1. Dynamic Hydra membership mid-game support timeline?
2. Maximum game state complexity before latency degrades?
3. Head reuse vs new heads per game (recovery implications)?

### Market
4. Specific retention metrics from past Catalyst gaming projects?
5. Discord Activities + Web3 case study data (limited public info)?
6. Optimal incentive structure for competitive play?

### Operational
7. UTXO.dev integration status within Discord iframe?
8. Discord developer fees for Activities?
9. Community moderator recruitment for testing?

# Polyhydra: Ideation Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-26
**Status:** Research Complete, Ready for Proposal Development

---

## Problem Statement

Cardano's gaming ecosystem lacks casual, accessible games despite having advanced infrastructure (Hydra L2). No board games exist on Cardano, and no blockchain has a Monopoly-style game utilizing state channels for true peer-to-peer, trustless gameplay.

**200-char version for proposal:**
> Cardano lacks casual games; no blockchain Monopoly uses L2 state channels. Players face high fees, server dependency, and no true asset ownership in existing alternatives.

---

## Proposed Solution: Polyhydra

A Monopoly-style multiplayer board game running on Cardano's Hydra Layer 2, enabling:
- Real-time turn-based gameplay with <1s transaction confirmation
- True property ownership via CIP-68 dynamic NFTs
- Zero transaction fees during gameplay
- Provably fair dice rolls and game mechanics
- 2-8 player game sessions in isolated Hydra Heads

**200-char version for proposal:**
> We'll build Polyhydra: Monopoly-style game on Hydra L2 with zero-fee turns, CIP-68 property NFTs, provably fair mechanics, and true p2p gameplay—first board game on Cardano.

## Unique Value Proposition

| Differentiator | Polyhydra | Competitors |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Transaction Cost | Zero (Hydra) | Gas fees |
| Game State | On-chain verifiable | Server-dependent |
| Asset Ownership | True (native tokens) | Platform-locked |
| Latency | <1 second | 3-15 seconds |
| Trustlessness | Full | Partial/None |
| NFT Standard | CIP-68 (dynamic) | Static NFTs |

---

## Preliminary Impact Metrics

### Quantitative
- Target: 2,000+ unique players (Year 1)
- Target: 10,000+ game sessions
- Target: 5,000+ Hydra Heads opened
- Target: 100,000+ on-chain transactions
- Target: 1,000+ property NFTs minted

### Qualitative
- Demonstrate Hydra production viability
- Lower barrier to Cardano gaming entry
- Showcase CIP-68 dynamic NFT capabilities
- Create reusable Hydra gaming framework

## Feasibility Assessment

### Technical Requirements
| Component | Availability | Risk |
|-----------|--------------|------|
| Hydra SDK | Available | Low |
| Plutus Scripts | Mature | Low |
| CIP-68 Standard | Adopted | Low |
| Web Frontend | Standard tech | Low |
| Wallet Integration | SDKs exist | Medium |
| Hydra Head Management | Custom needed | Medium |

### Team Requirements
- 1-2 Plutus/Haskell developers
- 1 Frontend developer (React/TypeScript)
- 1 UI/UX designer
- 1 Project manager (part-time)
- Game design consultant (optional)

### Timeline Estimate
- **Month 1-2:** Architecture, smart contracts
- **Month 3-4:** Hydra integration, core gameplay
- **Month 5-6:** Frontend, wallet integration
- **Month 7-8:** NFT marketplace, testing
- **Month 9-10:** Beta launch, community testing
- **Month 11-12:** Production launch, documentation

---

## Budget Range Estimate

### Conservative (75,000 ADA / ~$31,500)
- Core gameplay MVP
- Basic NFT integration
- Testnet deployment
- Minimal marketing

### Standard (150,000 ADA / ~$63,000)
- Full gameplay features
- Dynamic NFT properties
- Mainnet deployment
- Community building
- Documentation

### Full Scope (200,000 ADA / ~$84,000)
- All standard features
- Mobile-responsive design
- Tournament system
- Developer SDK
- Extensive marketing

## Key Differentiators

1. **First Hydra Game:** No production game on Hydra exists
2. **Board Game Pioneer:** Untapped genre on Cardano
3. **Zero-Fee Gameplay:** Major UX advantage
4. **Dynamic NFTs:** CIP-68 evolving properties
5. **True Decentralization:** No server dependency
6. **Familiar Mechanics:** Monopoly recognition

## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Hydra complexity | Medium | High | Phased development, SDK usage |
| User adoption | Medium | Medium | Free-to-play option, familiar game |
| Token volatility | Medium | Low | ADA-based, optional rewards |
| Regulatory | Low | High | Skill-based, optional P2E |
| Competition | Low | Medium | First mover advantage |

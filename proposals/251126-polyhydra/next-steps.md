## Recommended Actions Before Proposal Writing

### Priority 1: Team Formation (CRITICAL)

**Required Roles:**
1. **Lead Developer** - Plutus/Haskell experience
   - Needs: LinkedIn, GitHub, prior Cardano work
2. **Frontend Developer** - React/TypeScript
   - Needs: Portfolio, verifiable experience
3. **Project Lead** - Blockchain project management
   - Needs: Prior Catalyst or web3 projects

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Identify team members with verifiable credentials

- [ ] Document relevant experience for each member

### Priority 2: Technical Decisions

**Questions to Answer:**
1. **Tokenomics Model**
   - Option A: ADA-only (simpler, lower risk)
   - Option B: Native game token (more complex, P2E potential)
   - **Recommendation:** Start ADA-only, token in future phase

2. **Entry Model**
   - Option A: Free-to-play (maximum adoption)
   - Option B: NFT required (revenue from start)
   - **Recommendation:** Free-to-play with optional NFT purchases

3. **Property Theme**
   - Option A: Original Cardano-themed properties
   - Option B: Generic city properties
   - **Recommendation:** Cardano ecosystem theme (Catalyst City, Plutus Plaza, etc.)

### Priority 3: Budget Finalization

**Recommended Budget:** 150,000 ADA (~$63,000)

**Breakdown Template:**
| Category | ADA | USD | % |
|----------|-----|-----|---|
| Smart Contract Dev | 50,000 | $21,000 | 33% |
| Frontend Dev | 40,000 | $16,800 | 27% |
| UI/UX Design | 20,000 | $8,400 | 13% |
| Testing/QA | 15,000 | $6,300 | 10% |
| Documentation | 10,000 | $4,200 | 7% |
| Marketing | 10,000 | $4,200 | 7% |
| Contingency | 5,000 | $2,100 | 3% |
| **Total** | **150,000** | **$63,000** | 100% |

### Priority 4: Milestone Definition

**Suggested Structure (150K ADA = 4+ milestones required):**

| Milestone | Deliverable | Month | ADA |
|-----------|-------------|-------|-----|
| M1 | Smart contracts on testnet | 3 | 35,000 |
| M2 | Playable alpha (web UI) | 6 | 40,000 |
| M3 | Beta with NFT marketplace | 9 | 40,000 |
| M4 | Mainnet launch + close-out | 12 | 35,000 |

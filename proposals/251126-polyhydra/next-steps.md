## Additional Research Needed

### If Time Permits
1. Interview 5-10 Cardano gamers for demand validation
2. Analyze Hydra Doom codebase for patterns
3. Review successful Fund14 gaming proposals
4. Explore IOG Hydra SDK documentation deeper

### Nice-to-Have
1. Create visual mockups of game UI
2. Build detailed technical architecture doc
3. Draft tokenomics (if pursuing native token)
4. Prepare pitch deck for community

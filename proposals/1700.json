Fida builds the system\\. Charli3 brings the data\\.**\n\nInsurance policies are converted into smart contracts and data is provided be decentralized oracle networks to trigger payouts. Cardano users can stake funds to earn yield while payouts to policyholders are taken from staked funds. Instead of traditional insurance, when frost destroys a farm’s yield, that farmer can see a payout on the same day. With Syngenta’s 3M farmers, the value goes a step further to provide protection against those events – protection that they’ve never had access to before this project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**The solution has three main parts:**\n\n1. Database of Policies\n2. Real World Data Verification System designed by Charli3 Oracles\n3. Risk Transfer Platform designed by Fida Finance\n\n**1 \\- Database of Policies**\n\nThe first task for the team is to create or define policies from their standard format (e.g. frost damage insurance for farmers) into configurations ready to determine the operations of both oracle networks and the Risk Transfer Platform.\n\nParametric Insurance Policy → Configuration file for blockchain oracle network setup\n\nThis is one of the few parts of the process that will remain manual at this time. A configuration file for a blockchain oracle determines parameters such as data sources, triggers for updating data on-chain (e.g. such as price deviation), regular heartbeat update intervals, number of nodes, and so on.\n\nParametric Insurance Policy → Smart Contract Logic for the Risk Transfer Platform\n\nLikewise, the Fida Finance team needs to define the exact parameters and threshold values for triggering policy payouts. These will inform the creation of smart contracts and allow configuration of smart contract logic for each policy. Each policy will have a corresponding smart contract that triggers upon receiving the right data and that causes an automated payout in ADA (or USDM or fiat if we can implement these solutions in time). Converting policies into smart contracts is likely a manual process for this project, but can be automated in the future to enable rapid scaling. It is important to note that architecture and processes for this step are already built and Fida will be customizing a solution based on what already exists to deliver this project.\n\nThe project team will need to build a reliable back-end database solution to store this information, it will become the source of truth for both the Data Verification and the Risk Transfer Platform. We will consider an entirely on-chain solution if feasible.\n\n**2 \\- Parametric Insurance Data Verification System**\n\nSecond, Charli3 Oracles will design and build a Parametric Insurance Data Verification System (PID System) that is optimized specifically for this use-case and driven by Charli3’s enshrined blockchain oracle networks.\n\n**About Charli3 Oracles**\n\n- Charli3 Oracles is the first decentralized enshrined oracle solution on Cardano. The first live data feeds on mainnet launched in 2022. We specialize in delivering real world data onto the Cardano blockchain to be used as input in Decentralized Applications.\n- 15,000+ hours of continuous Ecosystem uptime (100% uptime)\n- 30,000+ successful updates on-chain\n- 125,000+ successful node updates on-chain\n- 4 distinct alert and monitoring systems to catch issues before they happen\n- Plan to fully open source all solutions in 2026\n\n**Configuration of Oracle Network**\n\nThe policies will be converted into configurations that direct the function of an oracle network. Oracle networks will be set up that monitor and deliver data on-chain for consumption by smart contracts. The architecture to do this already exists, but we will need to customize the datum onchain and integration with satellite oracle data from Syngenta. This customization is non-trivial.\n\n**Data Monitoring**\n\nOnce an oracle network is configured and deployed, the first function of the system will be to monitor data sources in real-time (e.g. every 2 minutes). Since Nodes running the Charli3 Node Software already monitor deviations for price pairs, we can adapt this monitoring tool for different policies. There may be customizations to the current Charli3 Oracle architecture to optimize for this use-case that we’ve accounted for in the milestones and budget. Positive responses from the monitoring solution trigger the second part of the solution: data verification.\n\n**Data Verification via Oracle Networks**\n\nAfter the monitoring service (run by node operators, automated, and built into the node software) identifies a parameter threshold being met, it then triggers the oracle network assigned to verify the real world event by querying the data sources, aggregating the results, and passing it along to an on-chain (second processing step) aggregation contract.\n\nCharli3 Oracles has an already built and tested system to do all of this work: [https://docs\\.charli3\\.io/oracles/products/pull\\-oracle/infrastructure\\.](https://docs.charli3.io/oracles/products/pull-oracle/infrastructure.) It just needs to be optimized for the data sources, parameters, and expected on-chain value for Parametric Insurance policies. The final on-chain is the culmination of all the independent external node operators verifying multiple data sources and the Charli3 aggregation contract removing any outliers and nefarious node activity. This on-chain data becomes input for the third part of the system, the Risk Transfer Platform.\n\nThe expectation is that a single Oracle Network will service multiple policies, but we will likely need to create many networks to scale the service. We will determine how to do this efficiently during the project architectural design phase.\n\n**3 \\- Risk Transfer Platform**\n\nThe function of the Risk Transfer Platform is to:\n\n- consume values from the PID System\n- trigger the automated claims approval process\n- trigger the automated payout system\n- act as an UI/UX for customers to check statuses of claims\n- Leveraging Cardano’s smart contract functionality and Fida’s knowledge of converting policies into on-chain smart contracts, the Risk Transfer Platform is an end-to-end solution for automating Parametric Insurance. While significant challenges with the current way parametric insurance is executed by integrating with a blockchain oracle solution, the adoption of smart contract functionality on Cardano, to execute the approval and payout process, is essential to solving the challenges we address in the previous section.\n\n**Integration with PID System**\n\nFor this project, Fida will drive the design of this platform by translating parametric insurance policies into smart contracts with specific logic. An integration between the PID System may also be necessary to identify what specific feed values trigger which particular policies. There are different ways that we can integrate the two parts of the solution and will research which is the best option during the design phase in milestone 1. There have been discussions of a bitmap on-chain, but more research is required to settle on the right solution here.\n\n**Risk Transfer Back\\-end and On\\-Chain Setup**\n\nThe core function of the platform is to identify the right policies when a verified parameter is satisfied, then automate the claims approval and payout process. After receiving a triggering event from the PID system driven by Charli3 Oracles, the Risk Transfer back-end is a set of smart contracts that ensure that the specific policies triggered automatically lead to the right payouts. For this project POC, we will payout in ADA and likely on testnet to conserve funds. We will provide a report at the end of the project to describe the implementation of a live customer solution where payment may occur in fiat too (optional: if possible we may implement fiat or USDM for the project).\n\n**Risk Transfer Platform Operation**\n\nOnce smart contracts are configured, then the process between the PID System and payout should be seamless and automatic. The Fida team will construct a payment mechanism that gets triggered by the policy smart contracts. For the MVP, this may simply be an ADA payment to a crypto wallet or, if possible, a USDM or fiat ramp to a bank account of a policyholder.\n\n**Risk Transfer UI/UX**\n\nIn addition to automating Parametric Insurance, we will create a front-end. Prospective policy-holders can view policies and buy policies. While policy-holders can view and manage current policies. The exact design and functionality of the front-end will be determined in the design phase of the project. At the very least, the project will have a front-end that allows viewing and basic management of policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: \n\nThis project is an adaption of a previously submitted F13 proposal where Fida and Charli3 were partnering with the Howden Group: ([https://projectcatalyst\\.io/funds/13/cardano\\-partners\\-enterprise\\-randd/charli3\\-fida\\-howden\\-automated\\-parametric\\-insurance\\-using\\-cardano\\-blockchain\\)\\)\\)\\)](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/13/cardano-partners-enterprise-randd/charli3-fida-howden-automated-parametric-insurance-using-cardano-blockchain)))))\n\n\n\n**Key Changes:**\n\n- Howden group is no longer involved\n- Policies are not provided by Howden\n- Syngenta replaces Howden Group\n- Syngenta provides 3M farmers as potential policy holders\n- Premiums (funds to back insurance policies) can be provided by any Cardano user providing yield opportunities and potential for very large TVL if institutional investors or insurance companies participate via USDM, BTC, ADA, or etc.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"Value to the community:\n\n```\nMassive Increase in On-Chain Activity and Transactions\n```\nBenefit: A large insurance company integrating with Cardano would result in substantial on-chain activity due to the automation of claims, payments, policy management, and data recording.

This addresses financial exclusion and climate vulnerability head-on.\n\n\n\nMassive, Validated User Base: The project is not starting from scratch. It directly integrates with the Syngenta Foundation's Agri-Entrepreneur (AE) program, which already operates a verified, trusted, last-mile network of over 21,000 AEs serving 2.3 million farmers across India. This guarantees immediate, high-volume exposure and impact for a Cardano-based solution.\n\n\n\nFoundation for Future DeFi: By leveraging CHARLI3 for verifiable Earth Observation (EO) data, the project establishes a fundamental primitive: a verifiable digital identity for land parcels. This single, trustless data layer serves as the foundation for a suite of future on-chain services, including credit scoring, sustainable certification, and more complex lending/DeFi products.\n\n\n\nIt can accomplish this because we will use of the established SFSA network dramatically reduces the cost and risk typically associated with deploying grassroots technology solutions in emerging markets.\n\n\n\nLeveraging Existing Infrastructure: The proposal avoids the massive expenditure required to build a distribution, training, and trust network. It integrates directly with the Agri-Entrepreneur Digital Diary (AEDD) application —a system already in use by the AEs. This strategy minimizes development costs and maximizes adoption by fitting the solution into an existing, proven workflow.\n\n\n\nReduced Implementation Risk: The Syngenta Foundation provides the critical human layer of validation and support. The AEs act as trusted intermediaries, mitigating the risk of user error, technical illiteracy, and data disputes in rural areas. This dramatically improves the chance of the technology achieving real-world usage and success, ensuring the Catalyst funds are efficiently spent.\n\n\n\nAutomation for Scale: The reliance on parametric contracts and the CHARLI3 Oracle automates the most costly and slowest part of traditional financial protection: verification and disbursement. This eliminates the need for expensive manual loss adjusters and reduces administrative overhead, allowing the solution to scale cost-effectively across millions of farmers.\n\n\n\nFinally, there is a Clear Scaling Pathway: The SFSA's long-term vision is to scale their network from the current 23,000 AEs to 100,000 AEs, reaching approximately 15 million smallholder farmers. A successful pilot using Catalyst funds positions Cardano as the default blockchain infrastructure for this expansion, securing millions of future users for the platform.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the lead applicant is a verified legal business entity.","description":"Legal Entity:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the lead org has a ≥2-year track record, and the consortium collectively has ≥$5M in verifiable annual revenue.","description":"Track Record & Revenue:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of collaboration with a qualified Tier-1 enterprise is provided.","description":" Tier-1 Collaboration:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal is for mature R&D or integration, not an early-stage concept or core infrastructure.","description":"Scope Fit:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of a mature product is provided, with a clear integration plan if not already on Cardano.","description":"Mature Product & Path:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that all key partners, including the Tier-1 collaborator, are clearly identified.","description":"Partner Identification:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that a clear statement of the partner's in-kind or financial contributions is included.","description":"Partner Commitment:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal provides verifiable references (e.g., LinkedIn, portfolio) for key team members.","description":"Verifiable Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes clear KPIs for adoption (e.g., transaction volume, user growth).

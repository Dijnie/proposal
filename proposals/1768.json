Users cannot independently verify their point balances, expiration dates, or transaction history, leading to trust issues. Businesses face operational inefficiencies, data disputes, and limited ability to audit or automate loyalty operations.\n\nOur team currently operates a real world, fully functional offchain loyalty system at [https://soibien\\.vn/\\.](https://soibien.vn/.) While effective, its offchain nature limits transparency, trustlessness, interoperability, and scalability across partners.\n\n\n\n**Proposed Solution**\n\nWe will migrate and extend our existing offchain loyalty product onto the Cardano blockchain, creating a transparent, tamper proof, and automated loyalty management system. The solution uses smart contracts and a native asset, LoyaltyToken, to ensure every point issuance, redemption, refund, and expiration event is verifiable on-chain.\n\n \n\n\n\n**How the Solution Works**\n\n1. LoyaltyToken (Native Asset)\n\n-   A special token is minted to represent loyalty points.\n-   When users make qualifying transactions (e.g., purchases), LoyaltyTokens are automatically issued to their wallets.\n\n\n\n2. Smart Contract Architecture\n\nWe use two core smart contracts to manage loyalty operations:\n\n    1. User Container Contract\n        1. Function: Stores and tracks each user’s wallet, point balance, and expiration details.\n        2. Flow: When a user earns rewards, LoyaltyTokens are deposited directly into their User Container.\n    2. Order Container Contract\n        1. Function: Handles spending, redemption, and secure logging of loyalty transactions.\n        2. Flow: When a user uses points, tokens are transferred from the User Container to the Order Container, ensuring accurate recording of each redemption event.\n\n\n\n**Why This Approach**\n\n-  Transparency: All point balances and transactions are on-chain, eliminating disputes.\n-  Automation: Smart contracts remove manual operations, reducing errors and administrative costs.\n-  Security & Integrity: Tokenized points cannot be modified or duplicated by unauthorized parties.\n-  Auditability: Clear transaction history enables easy compliance and reporting.\n-  Scalability: The modular container architecture allows businesses to onboard users and merchants without changing core logic.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"**Positive Impact**\n\n- Our project delivers a real world application of Cardano by migrating an existing, actively used off chain loyalty system to an on chain Hydra powered solution. This demonstrates how blockchain can replace traditional backend infrastructure in live commercial environments; not just prototypes. \n- By running a production system on Cardano, we showcase the network’s transparency, speed, and operational reliability to businesses and developers.\n- This real deployment encourages broader enterprise adoption, expands the ecosystem of Hydra applications, and highlights Cardano’s capability to support high-throughput consumer use cases such as loyalty, rewards, and e-commerce integrations.\n\n\n\n**Measuring Impact**\n\nWe will measure impact using clear, trackable indicators, including:\n\n-  Number of active users earning and spending LoyaltyTokens.\n-  Transaction volume processed through Hydra heads.\n\nThese metrics allow us to quantify adoption, efficiency gains, and real-world usage of Hydra.\n\n\n\n**Sharing Output**\n\n-  Open-source smart contracts published on GitHub.\n-  Public web app for community testing.\n-  Transparent reporting of adoption metrics, user feedback, and technical updates via Github, or gitbook or Google Drive.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

Driving Enterprise Adoption\n\n The solution directly connects Cardano to traditional businesses through a Loyalty program that can be deployed in retail, F&B, and service industries. This lowers the barrier for enterprise onboarding and unlocks real commercial use-cases, an outcome that typically requires far higher investment.\n\n\n\n2. Solving Scalability with Hydra\n\nBy applying Hydra, the project addresses a key challenge for real-world adoption: transaction costs. Hydra enables high-volume micro-transactions at extremely low cost, making Cardano viable for thousands of daily retail operations. This provides high ROI relative to development cost.\n\n\n\n3. Bringing Mass Users into RealFi\n\nLoyalty points have real utility because they can be redeemed for products and services. This converts non-crypto users into blockchain users without requiring prior Web3 knowledge. The cost of onboarding each user becomes significantly lower than typical crypto adoption campaigns.\n\n\n\n4. Enhancing Network Performance\n\nThe project serves as a practical template for Layer-2 integration. By showcasing how Hydra increases throughput and reduces congestion, it creates reusable technical patterns that other developers and startups can adopt. \n\n\n\n5. High Leverage for the Ecosystem\n\nAll components, architecture, and learnings will be open-sourced. This means future teams can build similar systems at far lower cost, multiplying the value delivered to Cardano.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the lead applicant is a verified legal business entity.","description":"Legal Entity:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the lead org has a ≥2-year track record, and the consortium collectively has ≥$5M in verifiable annual revenue.","description":"Track Record & Revenue:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of collaboration with a qualified Tier-1 enterprise is provided.","description":" Tier-1 Collaboration:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal is for mature R&D or integration, not an early-stage concept or core infrastructure.","description":"Scope Fit:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of a mature product is provided, with a clear integration plan if not already on Cardano.","description":"Mature Product & Path:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that all key partners, including the Tier-1 collaborator, are clearly identified.","description":"Partner Identification:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that a clear statement of the partner's in-kind or financial contributions is included.","description":"Partner Commitment:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal provides verifiable references (e.g., LinkedIn, portfolio) for key team members.","description":"Verifiable Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes clear KPIs for adoption (e.g., transaction volume, user growth).

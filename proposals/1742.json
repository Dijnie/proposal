How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?","format":null,"answer":"**1\\. Proven event model from prior Catalyst\\-funded initiatives**\n\nSky3Team has proven, large-scale operational execution in Vietnam’s Cardano ecosystem. From 2023–2025, we have successfully delivered:\n\n- Organizing Cardano Blockchain Meetup Special in Hanoi and multiple offline builder meetups, reaching 70+ attendees each\n- Media partnerships and supporting flagship Cardano events (Cardano Night Hanoi, Saigon Ledger Night, Builder Fest Asia)\n- Hosting &amp; moderating the Cardano Builder Meetup Online Series (6 episodes)\n- Consistent community presence: 2,000 organic followers on X, 100+ active members in Cardano Builder, Dev Vietnam\n- Partnerships with Cardano Vietnam Community and multiple university blockchain clubs.\n\nThese activities demonstrate deep trust, transparency, and long-term commitment within Vietnam’s builder ecosystem.\n\n**2\\. Preliminary commitments from Minswap Labs and Danogo**\n\nMinswap Labs and Danogo – representing &gt;60% of Cardano DEX volume – have expressed preliminary support through ongoing discussions. They have confirmed interest in:\n\n- Providing advisorship for the hackathon as a whole.\n- Providing core contributors for mentorship sessions.\n- Sharing judging rubrics and prototype guidelines.\n- Offering post-event liquidity/marketing incentives for aligned projects.\n\n**3\\. Vietnam's Builder Landscape**\n\nVietnam leads Southeast Asia in blockchain talent, with over **6,000 qualified blockchain developers** already active (per Vietnam Software and IT Services Association, 2025) and a projected need for 200,000 more in blockchain/fintech/AI by 2028 (TopDev 2025 Report). As the largest developer hub in SEA (SEA Blockchain Developer Ecosystem Report, 2024), Vietnam boasts **560,000 IT professionals and 55,000–60,000 annual IT graduates**, with many focused on Web3.\n\n**4\\. Cardano DeFi Strength**\n\n- DeFi is Cardano's fastest-growing pillar, with TVL projected to hit $5–10B by 2026 via Bitcoin bridges, RWAs, and stablecoins like DJED/USDA).\n- Key protocols like Minswap, Danogo and Liqwid dominate over 60% of DEX/lending volume, driving transaction fees, liquidity, and ecosystem utility.\n\nTherefore, organizing a DeFi sprint is thus low-risk: It leverages Cardano's maturing infrastructure and VN talent to create primitives routing volume through Minswap/Danogo, directly boosting TVL/adoption.\n\n**5\\. Logistics and venue planning aligned with established networks**\n\nVenue selection will prioritize cost-effective co-working spaces in Hanoi, Da Nang or HCMC, depend on the location of GM Vietnam 2026. Budget quotes (7,000 ADA for 3 days) match rates from our previous workshops.\n\n**6\\. Grand Finale planned as a side\\-event at GM Vietnam 2026**\n\nWe plan to integrate the Grand Finale as **an official side\\-event at GM Vietnam Blockchain Week** (expected July 2026, Hanoi – based on 2025 edition at National Convention Center, 200+ attendees). Sky3Team has prior experience with GM side-events (e.g., Cardano Night Hanoi as GM Vietnam 2025 side-event).

Direct, measurable TVL impact**\n\nThe hackathon is supported by **Minswap Labs and Danogo** – the two largest DeFi protocols on Cardano. Winning projects are pre-committed to route liquidity and volume through these protocols from day one.\n\n**2\\. Permanent talent activation at ultra\\-low cost**\n\nVietnam has the highest builder-to-user ratio in SEA and ranks Top 5 globally in crypto adoption, yet contributes almost zero meaningful DeFi TVL to Cardano today. This single 60k ADA investment converts **15\\-20 senior Vietnamese builders** into long-term Cardano-native DeFi contributors – talent that would otherwise build on Solana or Ethereum L2s.\n\n**3\\. Maximum exposure, minimum overhead**\n\nGrand Finale as an official GM Vietnam 2026 side-event guarantees exposure to **200\\+ live attendees \\+ global attention**. All content (recordings, highlight reels, reports) will be fully open-source and distributed across Cardano channels for ongoing ecosystem benefit.\n\n**4\\. Zero credibility risk**\n\nSupported by the two largest DeFi teams on Cardano + a core team with 100% milestone acceptance on four previous large-scale Catalyst-funded events in Vietnam.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal is a non-technical initiative, with ≤20% of the budget for tech support.","description":"Scope Fit:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal provides verifiable evidence (portfolio, links, reports) of the team's ability to deliver the project.","description":"Relevant Experience:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes clear objectives with both Output Metrics (what proposal did) and Adoption-Focused Metrics (what effect proposal had).","description":"Clear Goals & KPIs:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly explains the user journey and provides a credible plan for how the project will equip and motivate users for future on-chain activity.","description":"Pathway to Adoption:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the initiative clearly demonstrates how it will grow the Cardano ecosystem or onboard users.","description":"Community Value:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the project plan and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic and well-defined.","description":"Realistic Timeline:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal commits to public outputs and justifies any exceptions.","description":"Public Outputs:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget adheres to all policies: it is for future work, follows the merchandise rule, and excludes establishing local treasuries, incentives/giveaways, re-grants.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

We assume that around 5000 Cardano users have an interest in poker.\n- In the medium term we are targeting poker players whose overall cryptocurrency user base is over 400m people. We estimate 6-12m cryptocurrency users are interested in poker.\n- In the long run the application can target all the online poker players. A reasonable working estimate is that there are  on the order of 100M people worldwide who play online poker. Basically, we could target all of them, given our competitive advantage of better security.\n\n**Benefitting the Cardano ecosystem**\n\n- By having the first fully decentralized Poker application in the Blockchain-space, builders in the blockchain space will see the advantages of building on Cardano.\n- This project serves as a demonstration of real-time interactivity for dApps, providing a model for future projects, not just within CAD (Card After Dark) but for the Cardano ecosystem and beyond.\n\nCarefully considered project costs:\n\n- Personnel costs cover compensation for a team of 6, working between 50% and 80% for the duration of the project, at a reasonable price - to attract and retain talents needed for the project success.\n- Additional costs cover infrastructure, consulting, and contingency fund, to cater for risk and market volatility.\n- Team cost is anyway below market rate, as we provide equity into the project, for the developers.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only;

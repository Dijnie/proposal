Unlike other solutions that rely on generic simplification, LINGARA adapts content for 15 specific cognitive profiles, making complex information accessible to a much broader audience.\n\n\n\nIts methodology is grounded in robust scientific research, referencing 120 academic sources, while most competitors lack scientific validation. LINGARA ensures 100% preservation of critical information (DIP ≥ 90%), whereas other tools often lose essential content during adaptation.\n\n\n\nThe platform integrates natively with the Cardano blockchain, providing transparency, traceability, and verifiable proof of compliance—features absent in competing solutions. This enables:\n\n\n\nLegal and regulatory compliance for Cardano-based organizations (e.g., EAA, WCAG 2.2).\n\n\n\nImmutable certification of accessibility adaptations via NFTs.\n\n\n\nOn-chain verification of impact and usage metrics.\n\n\n\nDecentralized identity management (DIDs) for users and organizations.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, LINGARA is fully open source (MIT License), giving the community freedom to use, modify, and contribute to the project. Privacy by design ensures no personal data is collected, aligning with Cardano’s ethos of security and user sovereignty.\n\n\n\nFor the Cardano community, this translates into:\n\n\n\nGreater inclusivity – enabling 1.3 billion people globally to access Cardano content.\n\n\n\nEnhanced adoption – removing cognitive and linguistic barriers for mass usage.\n\n\n\nStronger ecosystem credibility – providing legally verifiable accessibility solutions.\n\n\n\nAlignment with Cardano’s social mission – measurable social impact via blockchain transparency.\n\n\n\nThis unique combination of cognitive accessibility, scientific rigor, blockchain integration, open-source availability, and privacy by design positions LINGARA as a strategic asset for the Cardano ecosystem.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only;

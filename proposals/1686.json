There is no middle ground.\n\n\n\nSumbu NodeOS innovates by bridging this gap using **Coolify**, the fastest-growing open-source PaaS.\n\n1. **Platform Native**: Unlike existing scripts (Guild Operators) which are CLI-based, our solution is GUI-first. It lives inside the Coolify interface developers already use.\n2. **The \"Sumbu Dashboard\"**: We aren't just providing a config file. We are building a custom React-based sidecar app that runs alongside the node. This innovative dashboard visualizes \"invisible\" data (Mempool saturation, Sync status) and provides \"One-Click Actions\" (Vacuum DB, Restart) that usually require SSH access.\n3. **Mithril Speed**: We innovate on speed by auto-injecting Mithril snapshots, reducing sync time from days to minutes.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"We will deliver a working Alpha Release in Month 2.

We track this across three horizons:\n\n1. **Adoption &amp; Usage \\(The &quot;Volume&quot; Metric\\)**\n    1. Target: 200+ Verified Docker Pulls of the Sumbu NodeOS images in the first 6 months after launch.\n    2. Why this is realistic: There are ~2,000 active projects building on Cardano. Capturing 10% of the active market (plus new students) is an ambitious but achievable target for a &quot;One-Click&quot; solution.\n    3. Measurement: Public Docker Hub pull statistics and GitHub &quot;Clone&quot; traffic logs.\n2. **Product Retention \\(The &quot;Stickiness&quot; Metric\\)**\n    1. Target: 50+ Long-Running Nodes (Active &gt;30 Days).\n    2. Why this justifies the budget: Many tools get downloaded and deleted. A &quot;Long-Running Node&quot; proves that a developer is actually building on our stack.\n    3. Measurement: We will add an opt-in telemetry &quot;Heartbeat&quot; to the Sumbu Dashboard. This allows us to report: &quot;53 Nodes are currently live and syncing on Mainnet using Sumbu NodeOS.&quot; This is the ultimate proof of utility.\n3. **Infrastructure Velocity \\(The &quot;ROI&quot; Metric\\)**\n    1. Target: Reduce the average &quot;Time-to-Sync&quot; from 48 hours (standard) to &lt;30 minutes (Sumbu + Mithril).\n    2. The Economic Calculation (Value for Money):\n        1. If 50 developers save 2 days (16 work hours) each:\n            1. 50 Devs * 16 Hours * $50/hr (Avg Rate) = $40,000 USD Saved.\n            2. This explicitly covers the ~100,000 ADA budget request. The ecosystem breaks even with just 50 active users.\n    3. Measurement: A side-by-side video benchmark (&quot;Traditional Setup vs. Sumbu Setup&quot;) published on YouTube to prove the speed claim.\n4. **Community Validation \\(The &quot;Trust&quot; Metric\\)**\n    1. Target: 30+ GitHub Stars and inclusion in the Official Coolify Templates Registry.\n    2. Why this matters: Getting merged into the official Coolify repository means our tool becomes available to their 20,000+ global users, exposing Cardano to a massive Web2 audience for free.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Your Project and Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Solution","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","description":"Please describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem","format":null,"answer":"The &quot;Hello World&quot; of Cardano development is painfully difficult. To run a dApp, you need a node. To run a node, you need to understand Linux systemd, firewall rules, Docker networking, and topology files. This friction kills developer adoption.\n\n\n\n**The Solution: Sumbu NodeOS**\n\nWe are building the **&quot;Vercel experience&quot;** for Cardano Infrastructure.\n\n1. **The Stack**: We package Cardano Node, Ogmios (Interface), Kupo (Indexer), and Hydra (L2) into a cohesive Docker Compose stack optimized for Coolify.\n2. **The Interface**: We develop the Sumbu Dashboard, a lightweight web GUI acting as the control center. It connects to the node's internal EKG ports to visualize health.\n3. **The Maintenance**: Sumbu Labs commits to an LTS (Long Term Support) model. When a Hard Fork occurs, we push updated Docker images, ensuring the user's node never goes stale.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"1. **Stopping the \"Developer Churn\" \\(The Core Impact\\)**\n    1. Currently, Cardano has a massive \"leaky funnel.\" A talented Web2 developer (accustomed to Vercel/Netlify) who wants to try Cardano is immediately hit with a 48-hour DevOps wall: syncing a node, configuring systemd, and managing topology files.\n    2. The Reality: 90% of them give up or rely on centralized APIs (creating central points of failure).\n    3. The Sumbu Solution: We remove this friction entirely. By integrating with Coolify (the industry-standard open-source PaaS used by 6,000+ organizations), we allow developers to deploy a sovereign, enterprise-grade Cardano Node in 60 seconds. We turn a \"2-day headache\" into a \"1-click action,\" drastically increasing the conversion rate of curious Web2 devs into active Cardano builders.\n2. **Decentralizing the Network at the Edge**\n    1. Most dApps today rely on 2-3 massive API providers (Blockfrost/Maestro). If they go down, the dApp goes down.\n    2. Our Impact: Sumbu NodeOS democratizes infrastructure. By making self-hosting as easy as clicking \"Deploy,\" we empower thousands of small dApps, stake pools, and students to run their own nodes. This creates a more resilient, censorship-resistant network where \"Host Your Own\" is the default, not the exception.\n3. **Accelerating \"Real World\" Adoption \\(RWA\\)** \n    1. As an RWA-focused lab (Ototentik), we know that real-world businesses (like logistics companies) cannot use public APIs for sensitive data; they must self-host.\n    2. The Bridge: Our solution provides the \"Enterprise Starter Pack\" for non-crypto businesses. A traditional IT Manager can deploy Sumbu NodeOS on their existing private cloud (AWS/Azure) without needing to hire a specialized Blockchain Engineer, saving the ecosystem millions in \"integration costs.\"","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

Sumbu Labs is based in Indonesia, allowing us to offer Senior-Level Engineering at a fraction of the cost of a US/EU team.\n        1. The Math: A US-based Senior DevOps Engineer costs $150/hr. Our Lead Engineer (Maulana) is billed at ~70 ADA/hr (approx. $25-$30 USD).\n        2. The Value: The Community gets 5x the engineering hours for the same budget, without sacrificing quality (verified by our academic and professional track records).\n2. **Tangible Software Asset vs\\. \"Research\"** \n    1. Many Catalyst proposals ask for 100k ADA for \"Research\" or \"Community Building.\" We are delivering a Tangible Product Suite:\n        1. A custom GUI Dashboard (Software).\n        2. Verified Docker Images (Infrastructure).\n        3. A Video Course (Education). Even if only 100 developers use Sumbu NodeOS, the cost-per-user is 1,000 ADA, a negligible price to pay for permanently onboarding a developer to the ecosystem.\n3. **Infrastructure ROI \\(The \"Saved Time\" Multiplier\\)**\n    1. We estimate Sumbu NodeOS will save the average developer 20 hours of setup time.\n        1. If we onboard 500 developers (our conservative target):\n            1. 500 Devs x 20 Hours x $50/hr (Avg Global Dev Rate) = $500,000 USD Value Created.\n        2. For an investment of 100,000 ADA (~$40k USD), the Cardano ecosystem receives $500,000 in productivity value. This is a 12.5x ROI.\n4. **Verified \"Sumbu\" Brand Security** \n    1. By funding an established entity (Fund 13 Winners), the community minimizes \"Rug Pull\" risk. Our team is public, verified by UGM, and has a reputation to protect. This reliability is \"Value for Money\" because it guarantees delivery.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only; excludes retroactive funding, incentives, giveaways, re-granting, or sub-treasuries.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

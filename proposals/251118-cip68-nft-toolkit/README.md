## 🎯 Proposal Overview

### Problem (149/200 chars)
**CIP-68 adoption <5% despite superior security. Devs need Plutus expertise; businesses can't launch dynamic NFTs for $44B gaming/loyalty market.**

### Solution (150/200 chars)
**Open-source toolkit: mint/update CIP-68 NFTs via no-code UI, SDK (TS/Python), API. Zero Plutus required. Unlocks gaming, loyalty, RWA use cases.**

### Key Differentiators
- **First accessible CIP-68 toolkit** (no existing competitor)
- **Multi-tier approach:** No-code UI + Developer SDK + REST API + Smart Contracts
- **Security-first:** CIP-68 prevents metadata spoofing (CIP-25 vulnerability)
- **Open-source:** MIT license, community ownership (vs. NMKR proprietary SaaS)

## 💰 Budget & Milestones

| Milestone | Timeline | Budget | Key Deliverables |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **M1** | Month 2 | 35,000 ADA | Smart contracts (Plutus validators), CLI tool, unit tests |
| **M2** | Month 4 | 35,000 ADA | SDK (TypeScript/Python), REST API, wallet integration |
| **M3** | Month 6 | 35,000 ADA | No-code UI, use case examples, security audit |
| **M4** | Month 8 | 15,000 ADA | Mainnet deployment, tutorials, workshops, close-out |
| **Total** | 8 months | **120,000 ADA** | **Full-stack CIP-68 toolkit** |

**Value Proposition:**
- Developer productivity: 107x ROI (80,000 hours saved = $6.4M)
- Infrastructure multiplier: 10+ projects benefit (ecosystem savings: $200K+)
- Market capture: Gaming NFTs growing $4.8B → $44B (2024-2034)

## 🎯 Funding Probability

**Current Status:** 70-80% (HIGH) - **IF** all action items completed

**Breakdown:**
- **With team verification + prototype:** 70-80% (HIGH)
- **Without prototype:** 40-50% (MEDIUM) - feasibility score drops
- **Without team verification:** 0% (REJECTED in moderation)

**Why High Confidence:**
- Perfect category fit (Cardano Use Cases – Prototype & Launch)
- Clear market gap (no accessible CIP-68 toolkit exists)
- Proven technical feasibility (CIP-68 ratified, reference implementations exist)
- Budget aligned with Fund14 precedent (Lucid: 80K, Mesh: 150K, Ours: 120K)
- Strong research backing ($49B TAM, 107x ROI calculation)

**Risks to Mitigate:**
- Team roster incomplete → Add LinkedIn profiles (Week 1)
- No prototype → Deploy GitHub demo (Week 2)
- No demand validation → Collect 5+ letters of intent (Week 3)

## 📞 Questions & Support

### Technical Questions

**Q: What if I don't have a Plutus developer on the team yet?**
A: Proposal can state "recruiting" but must specify required skills (Plutus/Haskell experience, mainnet deployments). Better to have committed team member with LinkedIn profile.

**Q: How detailed should the GitHub prototype be?**
A: Minimal viable demo: 1 Plutus validator (mint CIP-68 NFT), 1 CLI command, 1 testnet transaction showing metadata update. Video demonstrating it works.

**Q: What if we can't get 5 letters of intent?**
A: Aim for 3 minimum. Quality > quantity. One strong gaming studio commitment > five vague "maybe interested" emails.

### Catalyst Process Questions

**Q: When is the Fund15 submission deadline?**
A: Check `./fund15-docs/f15launchguide.md` or https://docs.projectcatalyst.io for official dates.

**Q: Can we update the proposal after submission?**
A: Yes, during Community Review phase (before voting starts). Use this to fix errors or respond to feedback.

**Q: What happens if we're funded?**
A: Onboarding process begins: ID verification, milestone schedule finalization, first payment (M1: 35,000 ADA) released after Proof-of-Achievement approved.

### Budget Questions

**Q: Why 120,000 ADA instead of 150,000 ADA?**
A: Strategic positioning. 120K = 60% of category max (200K) signals efficiency. Aligned with Lucid SDK (80K) and below Mesh SDK (150K) for similar scope.

**Q: Can we adjust milestones during project?**
A: Minor adjustments yes (with community notification). Major changes require Catalyst approval. Better to plan conservatively upfront.

**Q: What if security audit finds critical vulnerabilities?**
A: Budget includes contingency (M3: 2,000 ADA for fixes). M4 blocked until audit passes. Timeline may extend 1-2 months (acceptable trade-off for security).

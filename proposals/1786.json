Catalyst funds purchase five S23-class miners; all facility, cooling, electrical engineering, monitoring, and operational infrastructure is already provided by our existing hydro-powered mining operation.\n\n**Real Earnings &amp; Margins**\n\nAt current BTC prices, each miner can generate an estimated ~$25-$30 USD/day gross. After electrical costs, the operation runs at 50–60% net margins. With five machines:\n\n**Gross**: ~$3,750–$4,000/month\n\n**Net after electrical**: ~$1,900–$2,400/month\n\n**After 10% operator fee**: ~$1,700–$2,200/month to the Cardano treasury\n\nThis equates to an estimated 20–25% annual return on Catalyst’s one-time spend at current BTC difficulty.\n\n**Upside at Higher BTC Prices**\n\nBecause operating costs remain relatively stable, rising BTC price can dramatically increase treasury yield:\n\n- $150K BTC: ~$3.5–4.5k/month to treasury\n- $250K BTC: ~$6–8k/month\n- $500K BTC: ~$12–16k/month\n- $1M BTC: ~$24–32k/month\n\nThis pilot provides leveraged exposure to BTC’s upside without requiring ADA sales or treasury depletion.\n\n**Capital Efficiency**\n\n**Catalyst does not pay for:**\n\nUnrelated infrastructure, security, or operational labor. Nearly 100% of funds go directly into revenue-generating hardware. All BTC is sent to a public, auditable treasury wallet with a public dashboard showing hashrate, uptime, and inflows.\n\n**Long\\-Term Benefit**\n\nThe pilot establishes a scalable, repeatable economic model for Cardano, an industrial real-world asset producing continuous funding for public goods. As soon as Machine #1 comes online (Milestone 1), BTC revenue begins flowing.\n\nA single 200k ADA investment seeds a permanent, transparent, renewable revenue engine for the Cardano ecosystem.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only; excludes retroactive funding, incentives, giveaways, re-granting, or sub-treasuries.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

Students hold credentials through both QuarkID (Extrimian’s proven infrastructure) and Identus (Cardano’s enterprise-grade identity framework). This demonstrates that Cardano-based SSI can coexist with existing identity systems—critical for enterprise adoption where institutions operate across multiple blockchain ecosystems.\n\n\n\nIntegrated Identity + Payments for Institutional Compliance\n\n\n\nCurrent payment solutions don’t integrate verifiable credentials, and existing SSI platforms don’t solve payment utility. We combine both: students verify identity and make instant payments in one platform. Our closed-loop architecture enables regulatory compliance without requiring traditional fintech licensing—leveraging IFPE partners regulated under Mexico’s Fintech Law.\n\n\n\nMigration from a Proven Platform (Not Speculative)\n\n\n\nUnlike prototypes with zero users, Micelya is already deployed at Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero with active students. We’re not building from scratch—we’re migrating proven infrastructure to Cardano. The project won the ANUIES-TIC 2025 National Award as a leading educational innovation in Mexico, significantly de-risking execution.\n\n\n\nInstitutional Anchor Model for Scale\n\n\n\nWe leverage university mandates: students use the wallet for campus services, ensuring guaranteed daily active users. This model can replicate across 200+ universities in the ANUIES network, each adding 10,000–50,000 new Cardano users.\n\n\n\nRealFI Validation\n\n\n\nThis operationalizes RealFI with daily economic activity for underbanked students—financial inclusion through identity-verified payments rather than speculation.

(production deployment, not pilot) • 60,000+ economically active users by 2026 • First DualDID production implementation (QuarkID + Identus) • Closed-loop payment regulatory framework • Open-source components and 20+ pages of documentation • 2+ developer workshops and ecosystem training\n\n\n\nUser Acquisition Cost: • Cost per registered user: 1.75 ADA (~$3.50) • Industry benchmark: $50-100 per crypto user acquisition • We deliver at 93-96% lower cost than market\n\n\n\nLeverage Ratio: Extrimian contributes significant in-kind resources: • Existing Micelya platform and codebase: ~$200K value • QuarkID protocol infrastructure: ~$100K value • UAGro partnership and relationship management: ~$50K value • Executive oversight and business development: ~$55K value\n\n\n\nTotal project value: ~$615,000 Catalyst share: ~$350,000 (₳175,000 @ $2/ADA) Leverage: 1.76x (for every $1 from Catalyst, Extrimian contributes $0.76)\n\n\n\nStrategic Value: • Reference implementation replicable to 200+ Mexican universities • Each university replication: 10,000-50,000 new Cardano users • Potential 100-1000x multiplier on Catalyst investment • RealFI validation attracting institutional projects to Cardano • Competitive demonstration (projects migrating TO Cardano)\n\n\n\nRisk Profile: • Platform already built (execution risk: VERY LOW) • Users already exist (adoption risk: LOW) • Signed contracts (institutional risk: VERY LOW) \n\n\n\nThis isn't speculative development—it's strategic migration of validated infrastructure to Cardano, with institutional backing and proven team

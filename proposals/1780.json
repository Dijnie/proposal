This is a big barrier to growing liquidity on-chain. DeFi contains many barriers to entry for all users such as impermanence risk, yield management & complex systems. By automating these processes, we allow users to easily provide liquidity to Cardano.\n\n\n\nTo do this we introduce a multi-layer AI architecture consisting of:\n\n\n\n1. A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model trained specifically on Cardano’s liquidity mechanisms, pool structures, impermanent loss dynamics, and DEX behavior.\n\n\n\n2. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that stress-tests thousands of liquidity and trading strategies against historical, live, and synthetic market conditions.\n\n\n\n3. A self-improving optimization loop that continuously refines strategy selection over time.\n\n\n\nNo other Cardano-native tool combines AI to allow users automated LP management into a continuously learning liquidity strategy.

We have conducted extensive research in AMM mathematics and LP behavior, and have a strong technical network of AI and Cardano development specialists. \n\n\n\nThe best way to gauge the feasibility of a yield aggregation tool is to look at existing Auto-Harvesters on other blockchains. As an example, let's look at Yearn. The current TVL (as of 26/11) is $441,970,000. This makes it the 15th most staked protocol on Ethereum alone, and shows that there is a clear value to the service for users to engage. The largest yield aggregator, DeSyn Liquid Strategy, has a TVL (as of 26/11) of $1.2 billion. \n\n\n\nBeefyswap, another yield aggregation tool, currently holds a TVL (as of 26/11) of $220,100,000 USD. Each of these systems, individually, hold more liquidity than the entirety of the Cardano DeFi ecosystem.

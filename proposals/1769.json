Users who require confidential transfers — enterprises, DAOs, NGOs, high-value traders — must currently expose:\n\n\n\n- source wallet\n- destination wallet\n- asset traceability\n- linkability of transactions\n- wallet clustering metadata\n\n\n\nZeroTrace introduces the first practical, user-friendly, zero-knowledge private transfer system on Cardano, inspired by Tornado Cash but redesigned for Cardano’s UTxO model, deterministic execution, and Plutus constraints.\n\n\n\nKey Innovations\n\n1. Zero-Knowledge Note Commitment System\n\nZeroTrace uses Pedersen commitments + zk-SNARK membership proofs to prove that:\n\n- A user deposited to the pool\n- Without revealing which deposit\n- And without revealing who they are\n\n\n\nEvery deposit generates:\n\n- A note (secret)\n- A nullifier (to prevent double withdrawals)\n- A commitment (on-chain public value)\n\n\n\nUnlike Tornado Cash, notes are generated client-side, not by the contract, eliminating the risk of note theft.\n\n\n\n2. Unlinkable Withdrawals With zk-Proofs\n\nUsers can withdraw to any fresh wallet.\n\nThe zk-proof ensures:\n\n- You own a valid commitment\n- You haven’t spent its nullifier\n- You’re entitled to withdraw\n- No on-chain observer can link deposit → withdrawal\n\n\n\nThis provides complete transaction unlinkability.\n\n\n\n3. Multi-Denomination Private Pools\n\nTo maximize anonymity sets while keeping UTxO execution deterministic:\n\n- ADA: multiple pool sizes (10, 50, 100 ADA)\n- Native tokens: opt-in pool creation\n- Future extension: privacy-preserving NFT swaps\n\nEach pool maintains its own Merkle tree of commitments.\n\n\n\n4. Privacy-Preserving Fee Model\n\nFees collected:\n\n- Deposits: tiny fixed fee\n- Withdrawals: zk-proof verification fee\n- Part allocated to a self-sustaining treasury\n\nZeroTrace aims for long-term operation without ongoing Catalyst funding.\n\n\n\n5. Anti-Abuse Controls via zk-Policies\n\nUnlike classic mixers, Zerotrace includes policy-based proof gates, e.g.:\n\n- Withdrawal rate limiting\n- Optional proof of non-sanction-listed origin (future)\n- zk-based compliance modes for enterprise use cases\n\nThese preserve privacy while preventing system misuse.\n\n\n\n6. Non-Custodial, Fully On-Chain\n\nNo centralized server.\n\nNo trusted setup beyond SNARK parameters.\n\nNo third-party custody.\n\n\n\nAll state transitions are verifiable & on-chain.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"The MVP will demonstrate a fully functional private transfer dApp deployed on Cardano Preprod Testnet.\n\n\n\nCore MVP Features\n\n1.

A High-Impact Core Primitive for the Entire Cardano Ecosystem\n\nZerotrace introduces a fundamental privacy layer that many future Cardano applications can reuse: DeFi protocols, DAOs, payroll systems, gaming economies, on-chain identity tools, and treasury operations.\n\nInstead of each team independently building expensive ZK infrastructure, Zerotrace provides a reusable, standardized, open-source privacy module.\n\nA one-time investment creates a long-term public good that lowers development barriers and accelerates innovation across the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n2. Exceptional Cost Efficiency for a ZK-Based Protocol\n\nZero-knowledge engineering is typically resource-intensive and costly, yet the project is delivered with a lean team of four specialized roles covering all necessary layers.\n\nThe budget is tightly mapped to critical technical domains: smart contracts, ZK circuits, backend infrastructure, frontend flows, and project management.\n\nNo unnecessary headcount, no inflated costs, and no redundant spend-every ADA directly contributes to functional code, security, or usability.\n\nThe team has experience building similar systems, reducing research overhead and lowering risks compared to first-time implementers.\n\n\n\n3. Fully Open-Source, Maximizing Long-Term ROI for Catalyst\n\nAll smart contracts, circuits, libraries, and documentation are released under open-source licenses.\n\nFuture Cardano teams save significant development cost by reusing Zerotrace’s circuits, verifier logic, Merkle tree design, and UX patterns.\n\nThis creates compounding value: Catalyst funds a single privacy layer once, but many projects benefit for years.\n\nOpen-source transparency also minimizes risk, increases auditability, and strengthens ecosystem security.\n\n\n\n4. Low Ongoing Maintenance and Sustainable Operation\n\nZerotrace is architected for minimal operational overhead:\n\nOptional relayer services are decentralized.\n\nNo centralized data storage or server dependency.\n\nCircuits designed for low proving cost and efficient on-chain verification.\n\nThis ensures Catalyst funds the creation of a privacy primitive-not a system that requires constant financial support to remain functional.\n\n\n\n5. Strong Team Composition Ensures High Certainty of Delivery\n\nEach engineer covers a clearly defined, specialized domain:\n\nsmart contracts, zk-SNARK engineering, backend infrastructure, frontend UX.\n\nThe product manager ensures accountability, milestone adherence, and transparent reporting.\n\nThe structure minimizes delivery risk and maximizes the probability that every funded ADA turns into measurable, verifiable output.\n\n\n\n6. Direct Alignment With Cardano’s Long-Term Vision\n\nPrivacy is a key requirement for real-world adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nZerotrace brings Cardano closer to enterprise readiness, user financial protection, and responsible privacy aligned with regulatory expectations.\n\nThis makes the ecosystem more competitive with EVM-based privacy tools-while leveraging Cardano’s stronger security model.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only; excludes retroactive funding, incentives, giveaways, re-granting, or sub-treasuries.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

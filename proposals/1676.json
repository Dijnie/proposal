If Cardano has no projects ready, we lose to EVM chains. Our Lab explicitly incubates student projects to be &quot;Sandbox-Ready.&quot;\n- **Geographic Defense:** Northern Vietnam has C2VN (Academic/Theory focus). Southern Vietnam (HCMC) is the **Startup/Commercial engine**, and currently, Cardano is invisible here.

Visual-First Content Production\n- Produce high-quality Whiteboard Animations: that transform complex concepts into engaging visual (which can both supporting some part of the course offline, then enabling e-learning in the future)\n- Open-Source Distribution: These assets will be made available for any lecturer or external club, team (whether it is student based like C2VN, or non-student based like FIMI) to reuse, maximizing ecosystem impact.\n\n\n\n### 3. Integrated AI x Blockchain Training\nTiered Technical Training (AI &amp; Expert-Led) We separate training into two distinct tracks to maximize output:\n\n- **Eco Track:** AI-Assisted MVP (For Non-Techs): We teach business/finance students to utilize AI tools to fast-launch ideas and prototypes without needing deep coding knowledge.\n- **Dev Track:** Advanced Engineering (For Techs): For complex DApps, AI is not enough. Our Advanced Development Team provides mentorship on architecture and security, ensuring students build robust, professional-grade solutions.\n\n\n\n### 4.

We are not creating redundancy; we are filling specific structural gaps:\n\n### 1. The Geographic Vacuum (South Vietnam)\n\n- **The Fact:** Thanks to C2VN, the Cardano educational movement has successfully established in the North for at least 3 years through their contribution.\n- **The Pain:** However, **Ho Chi Minh City (South Vietnam) -** the country's economic engine and startup capital - lacks a dedicated, structured Cardano education presense.\n- **Our Strategy:** We step in with unique model, focusing on the dynamic startup culture of HCMC.\n\n### 2. The \"Speed\" Gap vs The 2026 Sandbox\n\n- **The Lag:** Few universities is develop blockchain curriculums but move slowly. Most official blockchain degrees are 2-3 years away.\n- **The Urgency:** The Vietnamese government's **Fintech Sandbox (Decree 94/2025/ND-CP)** launches in 2026. The market needs builders *now*.\n- **Our Strategy:** We shift the model from a \"Classroom\" to a **\"Pre-Incubator.\"** We prioritize **MVP Delivery** over pure theory, running intensive **2-4 week sprints** rather than long semesters, ensuring students graduate with a deployed project.\n\n### 3. The Operational Pivot: We Don't Build, We Upgrade\n\n- **The Bottleneck:** Universities have clubs, but they lack qualified lecturers.\n- **Our Strategy:** We do not build \"Hubs\" to drag students away from their campus. We provide the **\"Club Engine\" -** a turnkey solution of content, AI tools, and mentors - to **upgrade existing university clubs** right on their own campuses.\n\n## **The Core Solution: AI-Powered Blockchain Startup Labs**\n\nWe are operating a **\"Pre-Incubator\"** inside the university. Our solution combines **Expert-Led Technical Training** with **AI-Assisted Prototyping** to ensure students graduate with both deep knowledge and a deployed portfolio.\n\n### **A. The AI Engine & Expert Mentorship**\n\nThe biggest blocker for students isn't a lack of ideas; it is the fear of execution - especially non-tech students.\n\n- **For the \"Eco\" Track (Business & Non-Tech Students):**\n    - **The Barrier:** They have ideas but cannot code or write technical specifications.\n    - **The AI Solution:** We teach them to use **ChatGPT/ Gemini/ Claude** to generate detailed functional specifications and also learn the minimum required tech knowledge to build up their solution.\n    - **The Outcome:** A business student can define a complete on-chain product logic ready for development, moving from \"Idea\" to \"Product\" in days, not months.\n- **For the \"Dev\" Track (Technical Students):**\n    - **The Barrier:** Technical students often get stuck on **Product Design, UI/UX, and Market Fit**, preventing their code from becoming a usable product.\n    - **The Expert Solution:** We provide **Experts** (Cardano Devs) to mentor them on deep technical architecture, security, and smart contract logic-areas where AI is not enough.\n    - **The AI Solution:** We utilize AI tools like **Figma AI / Uizard** for instant UI/UX generation to validate product-market fit.\n    - **The Outcome:** Developers build robust, secure DApps that actually look good and solve real problems, without needing a dedicated designer.\n- **The Startup Formation (Cross-Pollination):**\n    - **The Strategy:** We do not keep these tracks isolated. Through our weekly activities, we connect Business with **T**echnical students.\n    - **The Result:** This forms complete, balanced startup teams (Business + Tech) solving the common failure point of \"dev-only\" or \"idea-only\" teams.\n\n### **B. The Curriculum: \"Startup Speed\" Integrated with Academic**\n\nWe do not remove the academic foundation; we upgrade its delivery method. We maintain the necessary fundamental courses about Blockchain and Cardano but deliver them in a way that retains retention.\n\n- **Visual-First Fundamentals:** Instead of dry lectures, we utilize our **Whiteboard Animation Library** to explain complex blockchain concepts visually. This ensures students grasp the theory more 60% effectively as researchs.\n- **Project-Based Modules: \nFor example:**\n    - *Foundations:* Academic modules on Distributed Ledger Technology & Consensus (delivered via Whiteboard visuals).\n    - *Action Modules:* \"Build your first DApp\" workshops where students apply theory immediately.\n    - *Trend Integration:* Case studies on Real World Assets (RWA) and DePIN, customized to Vietnam's market needs.\n\n### **C. The \"Passive Attraction\" Protocol: Winning Faculty Support**\n\nWe do not rely solely on Hub Network for access; we have our own strategy to make Universities come to us. We solve their biggest headache: **The lack of qualified blockchain lecturers and materials.**\n\n- **The \"Turnkey\" Strategy:** We provide a complete \"Boxed Solution\" to lecturers, including:\n    - **Visual Syllabus:** Explainer videos of courses we trained or new design for their students.\n    - **Assessment Bank:** Ready-made quizzes and coding challenges from those courses.\n    - **Co-Delivery Model:** Our experts handle the technical workshops while the lecturer maintains academic oversight (optional, if they want that)\n- **The University's Win:** They get to test a high-demand course without hiring new staff or writing a curriculum from scratch.\n- **The Result:** Lecturers adopt our club model because it makes them successful with zero extra work, creating a sustainable foothold in the university independent of external events.\n\n## **Implementation Strategy: The \"Funnel & Engine\" Model**\n\nWe do not rely on \"hope\" for recruitment, nor do we burn budget on cold marketing. We operate a highly efficient **3-Phase Execution Engine** that converts external hype into internal builders.\n\n### **Phase 1: The Input - The \"Event-to-Club\" Funnel (Leveraging Hub Network)**\n\nWe position ourselves at the \"exit door\" of massive student events to capture talent immediately.\n\n- **The Source:** We leverage **Hub Network’s 20+ planned events** for 2026 (Unitours, Hackathons, and Meetups) across Vietnam and Singapore\n- **The Mechanism (Active Conversion Funnel):** instead of hunting for students one by one, we capture the overflow from these major events.\n- **The Conversion:** Students inspired by a Hub event are immediately funneled into our Labs for the \"Next Step\" → converting \"event tourists\" into \"long-term builders\".\n\n### **Phase 2: The Process - Hybrid \"Pre-Incubation\" Training**\n\nOnce inside, we retain students by respecting their time. We replace boring lectures with high-impact build sessions.\n\n- **Visual Learning:** Together with direct presentation from trainer/ educator students watch our **Whiteboard Animations** to understand complex concepts (eUTXO, Consensus) without the classroom boredom.\n- **Practical Builds:**\n    - **Weekly Builds:** Short, high-intensity sessions where students must ship a feature, solve problems, share solutions…\n    - **Peer Reviews:** Tech students review Eco students' technical logic; Eco students review Tech students' market insight.\n    - **MVP Shipping:** Teams use the AI stack to accelerate the \"boring parts\" so they can reach the MVP stage within the semester.\n\n### **Phase 3: The Expansion - The \"Honey Pot\" for Faculty**\n\nThis is our strategy for independence.\n\n- **The Pain:** Lecturers are resource-constrained. They want to teach blockchain but lack the time to build slides, record videos, or design coding tests.\n- **The \"Honey Pot\" (Turnkey Courseware):** We provide the **\"Club Engine\"** package (Syllabus + Whiteboard Videos + Assessment Bank) for free.\n- **The Strategic Win:**\n    - Lecturers adopt our club model because it solves *their* content shortage.\n    - We get access to the university's official credit system and facility support without friction.\n    - This ensures the club survives even if student leaders graduate, as it is anchored by faculty reliance on our assets.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"### **1. Capturing a Top-5 Global Crypto Market (Commercial Penetration)**\n\n\n\n- **The Opportunity:** Vietnam is #5 globally in adoption, but South Vietnam (HCMC) is dominated by EVM chains because they \"shout louder\" in universities.\n\n- **The Cardano Benefit:** We secure the HCMC \"Silicon Valley\" talent pool now!\n\n- **Practical Example:** Instead of a student launching their Logistics Startup on Polygon because it's \"easy,\" they launch on **Cardano** because our Lab help them build on Plutus/Aiken easily, effortlessly.\n\n\n\n### **2. Positioning Cardano for National Infrastructure (2026 Sandbox)**\n\n\n\n- **The Strategy:** Vietnam’s **Decree 94/2025/ND-CP** opens a Fintech Sandbox in 2026. The government needs *working* pilots, not whitepapers.\n\n- **The Cardano Benefit:** We act as the \"MVP Factory.\" Our AI-assisted labs churn out **compliant, regulation-ready prototypes** that make Cardano a serious contender for national pilots.\n\n- **Practical Example:** A \"Finance\" student (non-coder) uses our AI workflow to build a **compliant RWA (Real World Asset) Tokenization Demo** for Vietnamese real estate. This project enters the 2026 Sandbox, putting Cardano tech directly in front of regulators.\n\n\n\n### **3. Maximizing ROI on Existing Ecosystem Spend (The Conversion Engine)**\n\n\n\n- **The Problem:** At the current, the ecosystem spends thousands on events that generate hype but <1% on-chain retention.\n\n- **The Cardano Benefit:** We act as the \"Net.\" We trap that traffic and force it through an 2→8-week build funnel, increasing the **Cost-Per-Acquisition efficiency** of every marketing dollar spent in the region.\n\n- **Practical Example:** **500 students** attend a Hub Network Hackathon. Usually, 490 leave. With us, **50** of them join the weekly Lab. By Week 4, they have **active wallets**, are **staking**, and are **deploying smart contracts** on testnet. Few months later, some can be on mainnet to serve the community.\n\n\n\n### **4. Creating a \"Zero-Cost\" Perpetual User Pipeline**\n\n\n\n- **The Mechanism:** We embed our \"Turnkey\" curriculum into official university credits at partners like **NTT & PTIT**.\n\n- **The Cardano Benefit:** Once integrated, the university pays the lecturer to teach Cardano. The ecosystem gets new users **for free**, forever.\n\n- **Practical Example:** **Lecturer A** at NTT University adopts our course. Every semester, they teach **100 new students** how to transact on Cardano. Over 5 years, that is **1,000 educated users** onboarded at **zero recurring cost** to the Catalyst Treasury.\n\n\n\n### **5. Exportable IP for Global Adoption**\n\n\n\n- **The Asset:** We release our **\"Visual Whiteboard Library\"** + **\"AI-Workflow Curriculum\"** Open Source.\n\n- **The Cardano Benefit:** A replicable \"Boxed Solution\" for any non-English speaking region.\n\n- **Practical Example:** A Community Hub in **LATAM or Nigeria** downloads our \"AI-Startup Lab\" kit. They skip 6 months of curriculum design and start training local developers next week, using our proven model.\n\n\n\n`<update done proof>`\n\n\n\n### **Quantifiable Success Metrics (KPIs)**\n\n\n\n`<update info>`\n\n\n\n**Output Metrics (What we ship):**\n\n\n\n- **20+ Whiteboard Animation Videos** (Complex Cardano concepts -> Visual Stories).\n\n- **10 Full Open-Source Curriculum** (AI-Assisted Blockchain Development).\n\n\n\n**Adoption Metrics (The Cardano ROI):**\n\n\n\n- **100+ New Active Wallets** (Staking/Voting/Transacting) - verified on-chain.\n\n- **15+ Functional MVPs** deployed to Cardano Testnet/Mainnet (Sandbox-ready).\n\n- **20+ Catalyst Voter Registrations** from new student cohorts.\n\n- **5+ University Lecturers** officially integrating Cardano courseware into their syllabus.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

The \"Iron Triangle\" of Trust**\n\nThis proposal succeeds because it leverages three pillars of power that no other student club can claim: **Government-Grade Trust**, **Institutional Investment**, and **Ecosystem Unity**.\n\n**A. GOVERNMENT-TIER TRUST (Hub Network & NDA)**\n\n- **The Power:** The project is led by **Hub Network**, an entity backed by the **National Data Association (NDA) - an** official national organization launched in March 2025.\n- **The Advantage:** H**ub Network** operates under this national umbrella, we are held to **government-level standards of accountability, commitment, and trust**. We are not a loose group of students who might disappear with funds. And the fact, all activities from Hub Network already planned and running. This ensures absolute project safety and delivery.\n\n**B. INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT (Infrastructure & Resources)**\n\n- **The Power:** We are plugging into **Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT) -** a Top 5 Tech University in Vietnam.\n- **The Investment:** PTIT (the university itself) is heavily investing in the **\"Eduverse\"** project. Their **Fintech Lab** is our direct partner in this initiative.\n- **The Advantage:** Even without a signed MOU yet, PTIT has already **opened the door**. They have allowed us to run **demo courses** for their students and are engaging in talks to build their **official blockchain course**. Most importantly, they are ready to **provide physical lab space** for this project and others from Cardano community.\n    - *Feasibility Check:* We have removed the single biggest cost and risk factor (Venue) because the university wants this to happen.\n\n**C. ECOSYSTEM UNITY (4+ Years of Expertise)**\n\n- **The Power:** This is not a one-man show. It is a coalition.\n- **The Veterans:** Our educational core - **Alfred Pham,** **Yao** (Whiteboard Cardano), and **Mr. Tung (VNEconomics) -** have **>4 years** of continuous contribution to the Cardano ecosystem.\n- **The Network:** Beyond us, other major Cardano companies and projects in Vietnam are ready to support with guest speakers, case studies, and mentorship. This is a \"Whole of Ecosystem\" effort.\n\n### **2. Operational Model: Separation of Concerns**\n\nWe avoid burnout by separating \"Growth\" from \"Product.\"\n\n- **The Engine (Product & Quality): Whiteboard Cardano**\n    - **Lead:** **Alfred Pham** (8+ years in media)\n    - **Role:** We control the *quality* of the education. We use our **AI-Assisted experiences** and **Visual Storytelling** (Whiteboard Cardano) to ensure complex tech is \"Grandma-friendly.\"\n    - **Output:** Delivering **6 Full Intensive Courses** over the pilot period. `<update info>`\n- **The Fuel (Distribution & Recruitment): Hub Network**\n    - **Lead:** **Mr. Chinh Van (Leon)** (Head of Growth, Hub Network).\n    - **Role:** Hub Network runs the macro-events. They will deliver **20+ Workshops, Meetups, and Talkshows** in 2026.\n    - **Output:** We do not pay for these 20 events; we simply stand at the door and catch the students. This funnel guarantees our 6 courses are always full of high-quality candidates.\n\n### **3. Strategic Anchors**\n\n- **North Vietnam (Hanoi):** Anchored at **PTIT** via **PhD Nguyen Manh Dung**. Access to the Fintech students & Lab.\n- **South Vietnam (HCMC):** Anchored at **Nguyen Tat Thanh University (NTT)** via **Mr. Nguyen Thanh Tung**. Initiating with existing Digital Economy cohorts.\n\n### **4. The \"Stickiness\": Why Students Stay**\n\nStudents often drop out of free courses when the novelty fades. We solve retention by shifting the incentive from \"Learning\" to \"Founding.\"\n\n- **Culture over Classroom:** Students do not stay for homework; they stay for the **Startup Culture**. We position the club as a pre-incubator, not a study hall.\n- **The \"Co-Founder\" Matching Engine:**\n    - By deliberately mixing **Business (Eco)** and **Engineering (Dev)** students in peer reviews and weekly builds, we simulate a real startup environment.\n    - Tech students get business logic; Business students get technical reality checks.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Milestones","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Project Milestones","description":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":null,"title":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","description":"The number of milestones required depends on the amount of funding requested.

We are building a scalable educational engine for Vietnam's top universities with a focus on **Testnet Deliverables**.\n\n\n\n**1. Focused Efficiency (Quality over Quantity)**\n\n\n\n- **Cost Per Student:** With 12 cohorts capped at 20 students each (240 total), our cost-per-student is **~241 ADA**\n\n    - *Comparison:* Private blockchain bootcamps in Vietnam charge **$300-$800** per student for similar intensive training. We deliver superior \"AI-Assisted\" training for **<30% of the market rate** because we leverage open-source curricula and volunteer operations.\n\n- **Cost Per On-Chain Project:** We target **20+ Functional MVPs deployed on Testnet** (5 per Course Track). This equals **~2,900 ADA per Verified MVP**.\n\n    - *Comparison:* A typical hackathon spends **$5,000-$10,000** per team just to get slide decks. We are generating **functional, auditable code on Testnet** for a fraction of that cost.\n\n\n\n**2. The \"Hidden\" Co-Investment (Leverage)**\n\nWe are asking for **58,000 ADA**, but the **Total Project Value is ~85,000 ADA**. The Catalyst Community gets >**30% discount** because our partners absorb infrastructure costs:\n\n\n\n- **Venue Sponsorship (~12,000 ADA Value):** Provided in-kind by **Hub Network** and **Partner Universities (NTT & PTIT)**. We pay **0 ADA** for rent.\n\n- **Operational Support (~10,000 ADA Value):** Daily club management is handled by student volunteers incentivized by career certificates, not treasury funds.\n\n\n\n**3. Permanent Asset Creation (The \"Club Engine\") 55% of the budget (32,000 ADA)** is invested in **Permanent IP**: the \"Turnkey Course Kits\" and Whiteboard Animation Library.\n\n\n\n- Unlike event sponsorships where money is \"spent and gone,\" this is a capital investment. Once these 4 Course Kits are built and hosted on GitHub/GitBook, **they cost 0 ADA to reuse.**\n\n- Any university, educational team in Vietnam (or globally) can fork our repository and launch their own club next year without asking Catalyst for funding.\n\n\n\n**4. Strategic Market Timing (Why Vietnam? Why Now?)**\n\n\n\n- **#1 Opportunity:** Vietnam ranks **#5 globally** in crypto adoption (Chainalysis 2024), yet Cardano lags behind EVM chains in university presence in the South - most active city.\n\n- **2026 Sandbox Readiness:** The Vietnamese government is launching its **Fintech Sandbox in 2026**. By training students *now* on **Course 2 (Market Transparency)** and **Course 4 (Supply Chain)**, we are preparing the exact workforce and use-cases eligible for this national sandbox, positioning Cardano as a government-friendly utility layer.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal is a non-technical initiative, with ≤20% of the budget for tech support.","description":"Scope Fit:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal provides verifiable evidence (portfolio, links, reports) of the team's ability to deliver the project.","description":"Relevant Experience:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes clear objectives with both Output Metrics (what proposal did) and Adoption-Focused Metrics (what effect proposal had).","description":"Clear Goals & KPIs:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly explains the user journey and provides a credible plan for how the project will equip and motivate users for future on-chain activity.","description":"Pathway to Adoption:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the initiative clearly demonstrates how it will grow the Cardano ecosystem or onboard users.","description":"Community Value:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the project plan and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic and well-defined.","description":"Realistic Timeline:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal commits to public outputs and justifies any exceptions.","description":"Public Outputs:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget adheres to all policies: it is for future work, follows the merchandise rule, and excludes establishing local treasuries, incentives/giveaways, re-grants.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

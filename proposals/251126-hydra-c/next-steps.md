# Next Steps: Hydra C SDK Proposal

**Date:** 2025-11-26
**Readiness:** NOT READY - Major gaps to address

## Priority Actions (Before Submission)

### 1. 🔴 CRITICAL: Advance Prototype
**Current:** 3 commits, basic structure only
**Required:** Working proof-of-concept demonstrating:
- [ ] WebSocket connection to Hydra node
- [ ] Basic message parsing (at minimum)
- [ ] Single commit/fanout example

**Effort:** 2-4 weeks of focused development

### 2. 🔴 CRITICAL: Complete Team Section
**Current:** Only "Vu Le Quang" listed, no details
**Required:**
- [ ] LinkedIn profile links
- [ ] GitHub profiles with contribution history
- [ ] Portfolio/past project references
- [ ] Roles and responsibilities per member
- [ ] Relevant Cardano/blockchain experience

### 3. 🔴 CRITICAL: Define Budget & Milestones
**Current:** No budget, empty milestone list
**Required:**
- [ ] Total budget (recommend ₳100K-150K)
- [ ] Cost breakdown (dev, testing, docs, PM)
- [ ] 4-5 milestones with:
  - Title, outputs, acceptance criteria
  - Evidence of completion
  - Delivery month, cost in ADA

**Milestone Template (4 milestones for ₳100K-150K):**

| # | Title | Output | Month | % Budget |
|---|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| M1 | Core Infrastructure | HydraWS, HydraJSON modules | 2 | 25% |
| M2 | State Machine & Events | HydraState, callbacks | 4 | 25% |
| M3 | Transaction Builder | HydraTxBuilder, UTxO query | 6 | 25% |
| M4 | Docs & Demo + Closeout | End-to-end demo, docs, video | 8 | 25% |

### 4. 🟡 HIGH: Complete Self-Assessment
**Current:** All 10 items = false
**Required:** Honestly assess each criterion, update draft

### 5. 🟡 HIGH: Strengthen Impact Claims
**Current:** "100-500 developers" unsubstantiated
**Actions:**
- [ ] Research C developer population in Cardano
- [ ] Identify specific IoT/gaming use cases
- [ ] Seek letters of interest from potential users

### 6. 🟢 MEDIUM: Partnerships/Community
**Current:** None mentioned
**Actions:**
- [ ] Engage Hydra Discord community
- [ ] Connect with cardano-c maintainers
- [ ] Reach out to IoT blockchain projects

## Outstanding Questions for User

1. **Budget:** What budget range are you targeting?
2. **Team:** Who else is on the team? Credentials?
3. **Timeline:** Can you advance prototype in 2-4 weeks?
4. **Experience:** What Cardano projects has team delivered?
5. **Partnerships:** Any potential users/partners identified?

## Recommended Timeline to Submission-Ready

| Week | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Prototype | Working WebSocket demo |
| 2-3 | Team/Budget | Complete proposal sections |
| 3-4 | Review/Polish | Community feedback, final edits |

**Estimated Time to Ready:** 3-4 weeks

## Final Recommendation

**DO NOT SUBMIT YET.** The proposal has a strong foundation (clear problem, validated gap, feasible tech) but critical gaps in:
1. Prototype maturity (biggest risk)
2. Team credentials
3. Budget/milestones

Address these before submission to maximize scoring potential.

**Potential Score (if gaps addressed):** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) across all criteria

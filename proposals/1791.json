By operating inside engineering, information systems, and business faculties, the initiative turns abstract blockchain ideas into concrete learning experiences tied to data, governance, and real operational constraints. Instead of relying on general awareness campaigns, the program anchors Cardano in a credible academic environment where research, curriculum, and student work naturally compound over time.\n\n\n\nThrough three on-campus workshops and continuous academic engagement, students and faculty gain hands-on exposure to Cardano wallets, metadata structures, governance flows, and the logic behind inspection-backed RWA models. These interactions create a talent pipeline that feeds future builders, researchers, and contributors into the wider ecosystem. All materials including slides, governance guides, student research starters, and lecture recordings are published openly, enabling reuse across Indonesia and by universities in other regions.\n\n\n\n**Key areas of positive impact include:**\n\n**1\\. Long\\-term academic anchoring**\n\nCardano becomes a reference platform for coursework, research topics, technical demos, and student innovation projects.\n\n\n\n**2\\.

We previously completed the Indonesia CAR-dano project under Fund13, producing on-chain inspection reports and meeting all reporting requirements. This gives us practical experience delivering Catalyst milestones and managing a project end-to-end with full transparency.\n\nFor this academic program, we work directly with Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM). Faculty members from the engineering and information systems departments are involved as academic advisors and hosts for the workshops. Their participation ensures that the content fits university standards and connects with existing research interests around mobility data, inspection systems, and digital trust.\n\nOperationally, the project materials, datasets, governance guides, and demo flows are prepared in advance with the help of UGM and delivered through scheduled on-campus sessions. No new protocol development is required; the workshops rely on existing wallets, governance tools, and metadata templates, which minimizes technical risk.\n\nFeasibility is validated through clear procedures such as formal campus confirmations, attendance records, feedback surveys, workshop documentation, and open publication of all teaching materials. Because the team has already executed a funded Catalyst project and is backed by an established university partner, the program has a predictable delivery path and a low execution risk.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Milestones","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Project Milestones","description":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":null,"title":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","description":"The number of milestones required depends on the amount of funding requested.

PubWeave aims to complete this vision by leveraging Cardano's eUTxO model to democratize peer review, adding a level of transparency and accountability that only a blockchain-based solution can provide. Users can connect their wallets to link decentralized identities, enabling them to request and write reviews on the platform.\n\nPubWeave is a product of Project Catalyst Fund9, with its mainnet deployment highlighted in the completion report and video (see 'Supporting Documentation'). Intellart is the company behind the project. We are committed to democratizing access to scientific publications as well as other forms of published content. By leveraging blockchain technology and user-centric design, Intellart aims to make high-quality knowledge accessible, verifiable, and engaging for a broad audience.\n\nThis proposal greatly expands PubWeave’s blockchain usage by introducing a token-based reward system: users earn PubWeave tokens (PW) for their contributions, creating a tangible incentive to engage while allowing them to use these tokens for meaningful platform activities. Merged with a professional marcom strategy and iterative UX improvements, community engagement becomes a top priority. By combining clear communication, rewarding interactions through PW tokens, and continuous interface enhancements, PubWeave ensures that users not only participate but also feel valued, creating a feedback loop that drives both platform adoption and ongoing refinement.\n\n**Partnerships**\n\nThespian’s developers have been the powerhouse behind PubWeave’s current form and will provide full stack development over the next year if this project is approved. The strongest evidence of Thespian’s work is the PubWeave platform itself: www.pubweave.com.\n\nPuzzlewood has played a key role in shaping Intellart’s positioning narrative and has developed a marketing communication plan for PubWeave, drawing on their extensive experience. See the Puzzlewood Marcom Plan in the 'Supporting Documentation' section.\n\nThe remaining work, including smart contracts, APIs, DevOps, and overall platform management, is handled by our internal team at Intellart.\n\n**Funding**\n\nOne third of the funding will go to each entity. After years of working on PubWeave, we now have a good grasp on our burn rate and costs. We are confident the requested funds are in line with the promises put forth in this proposal.\n\n**Separation of concerns**\n\nA product life cycle’s feedback loop is inherently cross-disciplinary. In other words, when a user discovers a bug, a developer must fix it, and while a developer’s goal is to build a great product, it’s ultimately the users who decide whether it is good. This underscores the importance of cultivating an early user base even as the product is being completed. “If you wait until you’re ready, you’re too late.”\n\nTo maximize efficiency, we are engaging in parallel the communications team (Puzzlewood), the full stack development team (Thespian), and the technology architects (Intellart), forming the three main axes of this proposal.\n\n**Axis 1: Comms**\n\nWe begin with this axis because it was the area we most lacked in the previous fund. We attempted to raise awareness for PubWeave through organic growth i.e., publishing scientific news blog posts, tweeting about them, and hoping for engagement. We go into details in our article: [https://www\\.pubweave\\.com/blog/marketing\\-strategies\\-for\\-an\\-online\\-publishing\\-platform\\.](https://www.pubweave.com/blog/marketing-strategies-for-an-online-publishing-platform.) The results were ambivalent. We concluded that a solid, consistent, and professional plan was necessary, which will now be delivered by a professional marcom agency.\n\nTaken from Puzzlewood's MARKETING PLAN TO GROW THE PUBWEAVE COMMUNITY:\n\nThis proposal outlines a phased 12-month marketing and communications program for PubWeave, focused on foundational, high-impact activities. The objective is to build a credible brand, establish a strong digital footprint with a central landing page for marcom activities, and engage the academic community through targeted outreach.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Establish a strong brand: Create a professional visual identity and a central ‘launch’ landing page to serve as the project's marcom front door.\n- Generate awareness: Introduce PubWeave to target audiences through a focused announcement and value-driven content.\n- Drive user adoption: Encourage early sign-ups and platform exploration via clear calls-to-action on landing page and prioritized social platforms.\n- Build community: Foster an engaged core group of early adopters through consistent digital communication and interaction.\n- Demonstrate momentum: Show tangible progress and community traction to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n**Axis 2: Fullstack**\n\nIn the Information Age, user experience is paramount. Even with excellent technical design, a complex interface, buggy graphics, or long wait times can undermine all backend efforts. PubWeave is already a fully functioning product, and both our team and others have produced numerous articles published on it. However, our UI/UX task list remains extensive, and each new use uncovers additional areas for improvement. This focus on continual enhancement should be straightforward and uncontroversial.\n\n**Axis 3: System architecture on the blockchain**\n\nIn its current form, PubWeave’s core value proposition is to enable peer-to-peer, paid peer review for scientific articles. In traditional academia, reviewers are not paid, journals gatekeep publicly funded research outputs and have a monopoly on the review process. PubWeave’s current mainnet functionality gives authors the ability to lock funds in a smart contract that releases payment to a reviewer once the task is completed. More recently, we extended this model with a moderation system for dispute resolution. We also introduced a bounty mechanism in the smart contract, allowing authors to post open calls for reviews, further decentralizing how scientific labor is requested, priced, and rewarded.\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to significantly expand PubWeave’s use-cases so that scientists, science amateurs, bloggers, and laypeople can all benefit from a decentralized publishing system. To this end, a PubWeave token becomes necessary to provide a unified medium for coordinating actions securely and predictably across the platform. Since payments, bounties, and dispute-resolution stakes all depend on onchain actions, a platform-native token provides a uniform “unit of work” that smart contracts can rely on without exposing users to volatile external currencies. The tokens are not designed to hold value as speculative assets. They function strictly as a platform currency used to perform actions. If a market price emerges organically, that is an external outcome; if not, the system still benefits by allowing high-contributing users to access more platform features. It also allows PubWeave to prevent spam or Sybil attacks, while letting power-users perform more actions without forcing a speculative economy. We previously outlined a theoretical tokenomics model: [https://www\\.pubweave\\.com/blog/revenue\\-sharing\\-model\\-publishing](https://www.pubweave.com/blog/revenue-sharing-model-publishing) and this proposal will allow us to refine and implement it.\n\nIn terms of additional features, we will introduce AI-assisted writing tools such as drafting, summarization, and style refinement, priority listing on PubWeave's homepage, and long-term decentralized archival. These features will be accessible using PW tokens. In addition, the current peer review smart contract system will be updated and PW tokens will become the default currency in addition to ADA. This creates a self-contained utility loop: users who publish, review, or contribute to the ecosystem earn tokens, and can then spend them on value-adding services directly within PubWeave.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"This project is, by nature, a real-world application (RWA). While it is not a DeFi initiative, the smart contract that escrows author funds while awaiting reviewer acceptance can be queried, allowing the community to compute metrics such as TVL, volume, transaction fees, transaction counts, and the number of users brought onto Cardano through PubWeave. All of these represent clear net positives for the ecosystem. As part of this proposal, we will build a public dashboard displaying real-time user counts, TVL, transaction volume, and accumulated fees, ensuring full transparency for the community. Additionally, we will continue publishing detailed progress reports, just as we did in our previous proposal, outlining achievements, challenges, and lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle.\n\nThe introduction of the PubWeave token (PW) creates a clear incentive layer for participation: users earn tokens for contributing value to the platform and can spend them on services such as requesting reviews or using premium features. This establishes a self-contained economy that drives repeated onchain actions while aligning user behavior with platform growth.\n\nAt present, Cardano does not have a native DeSci platform, despite the fact that DeSci is a rapidly growing industry in other ecosystems, particularly within the EVM space. PubWeave is uniquely positioned to become a leading player in Cardano’s emerging DeSci landscape. DeSci adoption is already accelerating on other chains, with tens of active DeSci projects, token-category indices showing market caps in the hundreds of millions, and major initiatives like VitaDAO reporting ~10,000 community members and several million dollars deployed to research. This momentum shows that decentralized science has proven demand elsewhere, creating a clear opportunity for Cardano to establish its own native DeSci presence through PubWeave.\n\nFinally, the upside of a successful blogging and publishing platform is substantial. A widely adopted platform generates continuous content, attracts diverse contributors, and creates strong network effects that rapidly expand engagement. For Cardano, this translates directly into increased users, higher transaction volume, and a visible, real-world application bringing meaningful activity to the chain.\n\n\n\nOnce this proposal is accepted, we will develop a dashboard providing real-time data on platform users, accumulated transaction fees, total value locked (TVL), and transaction volume. In addition, at each milestone, we will publish a detailed report on PubWeave covering our development experiences over the previous three to four months, alongside an overview of marketing outcomes as outlined in the milestones module.\n\n\n\nThe most significant impact of our proposal lies in onboarding a broad audience that might not otherwise engage with blockchain, and Cardano specifically. Through PubWeave as a content-creation platform, these users will leave on-chain traces of their interactions.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

They built PubWeave’s frontend, backend, and database schema. Well-established within the Cardano ecosystem, Thespian is widely regarded as a household name whose team members are active and respected in the community. Our three years of working together have consistently demonstrated their reliability and technical excellence, and the products we have developed with them, pubweave.com and marketplace.pubweave.com, stand as concrete proof of their capabilities.\n\n**Axis 3: Intellart**\n\nWe have been active in the Cardano ecosystem for four years, successfully delivering on our projects and gaining valuable experience in fund management. The outputs of these completed projects can be found on Project Catalyst's website. While it is easy to overpromise on unfamiliar technology, we are confident that this is not the case. Our team lead, Albert Feghaly, is highly experienced with the eUTxO model and leads the development of PubWeave’s treasury smart contract, now in its fourth iteration. In addition, Albert brings DevOps expertise and plays an active role in the deployment and operational management of the platform. He has also delivered on projects touching on decentralized storage and has experience in machine-learning has evidenced by his publications. Notably: [https://doi\\.org/10\\.1371/journal\\.pcbi\\.1009482\\.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009482.)\n\nOur GitHub repositories provide a clear demonstration of our technical expertise:\n\n- Treasury smart contracts written in OpShin: [https://github\\.com/Intellart/pandao\\-treasury\\-sc](https://github.com/Intellart/pandao-treasury-sc)\n- NFT marketplace smart contracts written in Plutus, developed with support from Thespian and ExactByte: [https://github\\.com/Intellart/pandao\\-marketplace\\-sc](https://github.com/Intellart/pandao-marketplace-sc)\n\nIn addition, our dApps and websites are public and explorable:\n\n- PubWeave itself: [https://www\\.pubweave\\.com](https://www.pubweave.com)\n- PubWeave's OpenScience Marketplace: [https://marketplace\\.pubweave\\.com](https://marketplace.pubweave.com)\n- A Cardano backend API exposing PubWeave smart contracts and NFT UTxOs for easy exploration: [https://cardano\\.api\\.pubweave\\.com](https://cardano.api.pubweave.com)\n- An Arweave utility for uploading and caching NFT data: [https://arweave\\.api\\.pubweave\\.com](https://arweave.api.pubweave.com)\n\nIn terms of feasibility, there is no indication that the proposed work will encounter insurmountable technological or financial hurdles.

We also believe that resources have been allocated fairly and proportionately across marketing, UI/UX, and blockchain development, ensuring balanced progress across all critical areas of the project.\n\n**Contingencies**\n\nRedundancies in capabilities between Intellart and our partners, Thespian and Puzzlewood, ensure stability and robustness throughout execution. As demonstrated with the treasury peer review smart contract, where a cold-storage private key can override user or PubWeave hot-account UTxOs (see the pandao-treasury-sc repository), we will continue to implement contingency mechanisms to mitigate hacks, mistakes, or other blockchain-specific risks. We also maintain a local cache of transaction data on our backend, with regular backups, which serves both as a reliability layer and a traceability tool.\n\nTo address potential low user sign-ups, promotional incentives such as early free credits for AI-assisted writing and bonus payments for the first cohort of users and blogs will be implemented as needed to boost participation. In the event of budget overruns, we will prioritize core development milestones and defer non-critical premium features while preserving a buffer for unexpected expenses. Finally, to mitigate regulatory risk, we will maintain ongoing communication with legal counsel regarding Cardano token usage ensuring that PW remains strictly a utility token. Until a solid legal and regulatory framework is established within Intellart and with the relevant Canadian authorities, we will operate strictly using the PW token, without assigning it any monetary value, and before enabling payments in ADA or any other value-bearing token. This approach prevents confusion about Intellart’s role and ensures we are not inadvertently classified as an exchange or financial service provider, which could trigger registration requirements or sales-tax liabilities (such as GST in Canada, also called VAT in the United States).\n\n\n\n**Sustainability**\n\n\n\nIf no monetary value is extracted, it naturally raises the question of how PubWeave becomes self-sustaining. The answer is straightforward: as PW tokens circulate and the user base grows, demand for premium features will eventually exceed what free or earned PW tokens provide. A portion of users, especially power users, institutions, and professionals, will be willing to pay out-of-pocket for more frequent access to advanced tools. In the early phase, PubWeave will subsidize participation while we establish the legal and regulatory framework required to accept fiat or crypto payments safely and compliantly. This model is common: platforms like Medium first focused on user growth before introducing monetization, although unlike Medium or Substack, PubWeave will never introduce a paywall. Open access is our core differentiator to the other platforms. The example simply illustrates that early investment and temporary subsidization are a proven path toward long-term sustainability.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Milestones","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Project Milestones","description":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":null,"title":"What are the key milestones you need to achieve in order to complete your project successfully?","description":"The number of milestones required depends on the amount of funding requested.

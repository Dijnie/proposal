Onboarding Vietnamese developers to Midnight directly expands the capabilities of the wider Cardano ecosystem.\n- **Unlocking Talent:** By providing high-quality, native-language education, we turn a &quot;user&quot; base into a &quot;builder&quot; base, enabling Vietnamese developers to create novel, privacy-preserving DApps that add real utility to the network.\n- **Grassroots Growth:** Sustainable adoption starts with education.

Providing text, code, and video ensures maximum reach and lowers the barrier to entry for the material.\n\n\n\n**2. Developer Adoption (Traffic & Views)**\n\n\n\n- **Measure:** Target **1,000 unique visits** to the documentation hub and **500+ total views** across the video tutorial series within the first 6 months.\n\n- **Rationale:** These metrics indicate real interest and \"top-of-funnel\" adoption, validating that the content is reaching the target audience of Vietnamese developers.\n\n\n\n**3. Active Engagement (GitHub Activity)**\n\n\n\n- **Measure:** Generate at least 2**0 interactions** on the GitHub repository, defined as a combination of **Forks**, **Pull Requests** (contributions), or **Issues** (questions/feedback) from the community.\n\n- **Rationale:** Passive reading is not enough for developer tooling.

This project delivers a comprehensive, data-driven system for tracking treasury performance, enabling smarter allocation of funds, reducing waste, and increasing accountability. By prioritizing open-source development, reusable components, and community-driven contribution, the solution maximizes impact while minimizing ongoing costs. With a funding amount of 150,000 ADA, this represents excellent value for money, protecting Cardano’s interests while ensuring responsible governance and long-term treasury sustainability.\n- The explorer provides exceptional value by unifying treasury tools, real-time analytics, and governance insights into a single, transparent platform, eliminating the need for multiple disparate systems. It delivers high-impact capabilities, including:\n            - Real-time treasury inflow/outflow dashboards\n            - Beneficiary transparency and ranking \n            - Long-term treasury sustainability forecasting \n            - Project accountability tracking with milestone monitoring \n            - Public governance intelligence supporting informed voter decisions \n            - Checks and balances between community and proposers milestone update\n- Beyond technical functionality, the platform strengthens the entire Cardano ecosystem by:\n        - Improving decision-making processes for voters and stakeholders\n        - Reducing governance inefficiencies and opaque fund allocation\n        - Enhancing oversight and transparency of funded projects\n        - Supporting community engagement and participatory governance through accessible, auditable, and actionable data\n- For a modest budget of 150,000 ADA, the project delivers high return on investment, ensuring that Cardano’s treasury is protected, optimized, and transparent, while laying the foundation for scalable, long-term ecosystem resilience.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only;

Unlike traditional booking platforms—which store user data in centralized systems, lack transparent reputation scoring, and provide no verifiable ownership of a reservation—HOTEL transforms each booking into an upgradeable NFT that acts simultaneously as a ticket, contract, receipt, and trust passport.\n\n\n\nThis is the first prototype in the Cardano ecosystem to unify:\n\n(a) AI-driven preference analysis that automatically builds a personalized booking profile,\n\n(b) DID-based identity linking to reduce fraud and eliminate fake reservations,\n\n(c) escrow-based booking settlement using smart contracts, and\n\n(d) a dynamic reputation mechanism (CVC Score) that rewards reliable travelers with lower fees, better cancellation terms, and priority room benefits.\n\n\n\nExisting hotel systems do not provide on-chain auditability or interoperable booking assets. Current travel NFTs are static collectibles, not functional identities or binding agreements. HOTEL leverages CIP-68 to create mutable metadata, allowing the NFT to update in real time at check-in, checkout, dispute resolution, and reputation scoring.\n\n\n\nThis innovation makes bookings verifiable, portable, programmable, and fraud-resistant—something no conventional OTA (Booking.com, Agoda, Airbnb) or current Web3 travel project has delivered at functional prototype level on Cardano.","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.","description":"Please provide your rationale.","format":null,"answer":"The MVP will demonstrate a fully functional booking workflow combining AI, DID, and blockchain:\n\n• A live AI Recommendation Engine where users input travel preferences and receive a structured JSON profile.\n\n• A Booking Smart Contract that creates an escrow, mints a CIP-68 NFT, and updates metadata through the user journey.\n\n• A CIP-68 NFT Viewer showing the booking ticket, DID linkage, CVC Score, payment data, and dynamic status (Created → Checked_in → Completed).\n\n• A user-facing booking interface with hotel listings, AI assistant, checkout screen, and wallet integration.\n\n\n\nThe MVP will be deployed on Cardano public mainnet, allowing anyone to interact with the smart contract using a supported wallet (Lace/Eternl).

Existing RWA efforts focus mainly on real estate, credit, or agriculture, with almost no large-scale consumer service applications such as tourism or accommodation. The ecosystem also lacks impactful service-sector dApps—especially in booking—capable of delivering a seamless experience competitive with Web2 platforms. Many proposed PoC projects have not achieved real user traction, and the onboarding barrier for non-crypto users remains high.\n\n-Despite the rise of digital travel platforms, hotel booking still faces major real-world barriers. Cross-border payments remain costly and inconvenient, with 2–5% conversion fees, unexpected card blocks, and slow refund times. Online fraud is widespread, from phishing sites to “virtual bookings” where customers pay but no reservation exists. User experience is fragmented as travelers navigate overwhelming choices, inconsistent information, and a lack of truly personalized recommendations. Meanwhile, high OTA commissions of 15–30% inflate prices, creating an inefficient system that burdens both users and hotels.\n\n**\\-Verification source:**\n\n[https://blog\\.checkpoint\\.com/research/check\\-point\\-research\\-warns\\-of\\-holiday\\-themed\\-phishing\\-surge\\-as\\-summer\\-travel\\-season\\-begins/?utm&amp;fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQPNDM3NjI2MzE2OTczNzg4AAEeh1Hg80wA7lSzIkhSvrRMcP\\_4Q7ZfvKyVUw0eXz8KcFsBAqYPVXvmvQvKT6U\\_aem\\_seBCjJ2ZZ41XoAL\\-UQerdA](https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/check-point-research-warns-of-holiday-themed-phishing-surge-as-summer-travel-season-begins/?utm&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQPNDM3NjI2MzE2OTczNzg4AAEeh1Hg80wA7lSzIkhSvrRMcP_4Q7ZfvKyVUw0eXz8KcFsBAqYPVXvmvQvKT6U_aem_seBCjJ2ZZ41XoAL-UQerdA)\n\n- - -\n\n\n**\\*Solution:**\n\nHOTEL-NFT platform to overcome the limitations of traditional booking systems by combining AI personalization with blockchain security. AI analyzes budgets, preferences, habits, and booking history to generate optimized recommendations, eliminating the need for users to manually compare hundreds of options. Blockchain enables fast, low-cost, fraud-resistant international payments through ADA, while smart-contract escrow ensures fair cancellations and protects both guests and hotels. Each reservation is minted as a CIP-68 Booking NFT containing hotel details, payment proof, DID identity, and CVC reputation, with real-time metadata updates during check-in, room changes, and completion. This creates a transparent, automated, and verifiable booking ecosystem—something Web2 platforms cannot provide—delivering a smarter, safer, and more reliable next-generation travel experience.\n\n**\\*Proof of Concept:**\n\n**Key features of HOTEL\\-NFT:**\n\n**\\*AI Recommender Engine\\-Data analysis and personalization:**\n\n**1\\.

By providing on-chain reputation verification, price clarity, reduced cancellation risks, and AI-driven personalization, HOTEL-NFT benefits both travelers and service providers. The target audience is divided into three main groups: (1) direct users such as individual travelers, groups, and corporate clients; (2) hospitality businesses including hotels, homestays, and small-to-large accommodation providers; and (3) members of the Cardano ecosystem such as Web3 users, dApp builders, and the Catalyst community.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DUALCORE-VuNam/PERSONAL-LIBRARY/refs/heads/main/Documents/HOTEL%20NFT%20Workflow%20Core.jpeg)\n\n**\\*Hotel\\-NFT platform general operating process:**\n\n**1\\. Customer enters booking needs**\n\nThe user inputs basic details such as dates, number of guests, budget, room type, and preferences. This data is sent to the AI Engine.\n\n**2\\. AI analyzes and recommends**\n\nAI processes all requirements and hotel data to generate an optimized “proposal profile,” showing the best room option and why it fits.\n\n**3\\. Customer selects and confirms**\n\nThe user reviews the proposal, chooses a room, and submits the booking request. The system prepares the on-chain payment process.\n\n**4\\. Payment via SmartContract escrow**\n\nInstead of paying the hotel directly, the user deposits ADA into a secure escrow smart contract, ensuring transparency and preventing fraud or uncontrolled cancellations.\n\n**5\\. System mints the CIP\\-68 Booking NFT**\n\nOnce payment is confirmed, the system mints a personalized NFT containing all booking metadata: ticket, receipt, room info, policies, DID proof, and CVC reputation.\n\n**6\\. NFT used throughout the trip**\n\nThe NFT updates dynamically with real-time states such as Checked-In, Completed, Rewards, and Reputation updates—forming a verifiable travel profile.\n\n**7\\. Refund or cancellation**\n\nIf the booking is canceled under policy, the smart contract automatically refunds the user. Any violations are handled transparently without manual intervention.\n\n**8\\. Trip completion and history saved**\n\nAfter checkout, the NFT is updated to Completed, and the customer’s CVC reputation adjusts accordingly. The NFT can be kept as a digital record or used for future rewards.\n\n**\\*Explanation of the meaning of AI Engine &amp; Aiken SmartContract &amp; NFT CIP\\-68 in the HOTEL\\-NFT model\\.**\n\nIn HOTEL-NFT, the AI Engine, Aiken Smart Contract, and CIP-68 NFT automate the full booking flow. AI generates a structured user profile, which the smart contract uses to mint a CIP-68 NFT containing all booking data. Payments go through an ADA escrow for fast, secure, global settlement. The NFT updates dynamically from booking to check-in, completion, and review, creating a verified on-chain travel record. This stack provides personalization, transparency, and a tamper-proof booking asset beyond what Web2 can offer.\n\n**CVC Reputation Score:**\n\nCVC Reputation Score (0–100) rates user trust based on payments, spending, cancellations, and loyalty. Higher scores lower deposits and unlock perks, with tiers: Silver (0–30), Gold (30–60), Diamond (60–100). The score is transparent and updated each booking.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DUALCORE-VuNam/PERSONAL-LIBRARY/refs/heads/main/Documents/A%CC%89nh%20ma%CC%80n%20hi%CC%80nh%202025-11-26%20lu%CC%81c%2018.34.45.png)\n\n**\\*Detailed explanation of CVC Reputation Score:**\n\n[https://docs\\.google\\.com/document/d/1lNClwNn\\_QqnjXYrQJ09bggj\\_AZHS5x\\-D/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=115422201608600606803&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lNClwNn_QqnjXYrQJ09bggj_AZHS5x-D/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115422201608600606803&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n\n**\\*HOTEL\\-NFT system layer architecture \\(Layer Architecture\\):**\n\n**1\\.Application Layer HOTEL\\-NFT Web3 dApp \\(Frontend &amp; User Interaction Layer\\)**\n\nProfile-Booking UI Interface - React / Next.js / Tailwind CSS\n\nWallet Integration - Lucid SDK\n\nAI Booking Assistant - AI UI Module\n\n**2\\.

This expands Cardano adoption to travelers, hotels, travel agencies and the Web2 community.\n\n**HOTEL\\-NFT demonstrates the practical applicability of Cardano Smart Contract**\n\nThrough Booking Contract, Escrow Contract and NFT CIP-68 Update Contract, the project shows that Cardano is fully capable of handling real-world commercial activities such as payment, escrow, verification and booking status updates.\n\n**HOTEL\\-NFT becomes a template model for Web3 Travel &amp; Hospitality**\n\nThe HOTEL-NFT model has the potential to be expanded into a Web3 standard for the tourism industry: NFT airline tickets, decentralized travel services, on-chain loyalty programs, anti-counterfeit consumer history and CVC Reputation system.\n\n**Increase transaction volume and TVL for Cardano**\n\nThe continuous flow of booking transactions — ADA payments, escrow locking, minting/updating NFT CIP-68, check-in/out, refund/cancellation — creates a natural and sustainable transaction volume. This is a source of long-term growth for the ecosystem.\n\n**Supporting the digital transformation of the tourism industry**\n\nNFT Booking becomes a tamper-proof receipt, allowing cross-border payments without intermediaries. This reduces costs, increases transparency, and is especially suitable for developing countries and units that want to reduce their dependence on Web2 payment systems.\n\nIn previous Catalyst rounds, proposals related to the tourism, accommodation or booking sectors mainly focused on applying blockchain to create transparent transactions or using smart contracts to manage simple bookings. Although this is a reasonable approach at the early stage, that model often has limitations: it has not solved the problem of personalizing the customer experience, has not integrated digital identity (DID), lacks a reputation rating system, and does not create a real “digital asset” that represents the transaction. These projects only add blockchain as a technical layer but have not created new value for the travelity industry.\n\n**Our team's HOTEL NFT project approaches the problem at a higher level, combining AI \\- Blockchain \\- NFT CIP\\-68 \\- DID \\- Reputation CVC \\- Automation to restructure the entire booking journey, turning traditional booking into a smart, automated, transparent and globally scalable process\\.**\n\n**1\\. AI Recommendation \\- Personalization that no project in Catalyst has done**\n\n**The AI ​​Core block of HOTEL NFT analyzes:**\n\n+Needs, budget, travel style, amenities;\n\n+Risk level, customer behavior, room cancellation/change habits;\n\n+Reputation history.\n\nFrom there, the system creates a Recommendation Profile - a detailed dataset that accurately describes customer needs - something that previous recommendations did not have. With AI, customers are accurately suggested suitable services, hotels save operating costs and increase conversion rates.\n\n→ This is a new value layer that most old proposals ignore, because they do not integrate AI as the foundation of the system.\n\n**2\\. NFT CIP\\-68 booking – the first time to assetize booking transactions**\n\n**Instead of just recording transactions on the chain, HOTEL NFT creates Booking NFT CIP\\-68 that can be updated in real time, containing:**\n\n+All customer request metadata,\n\n+DID verification,\n\n+CVC credit score,\n\n+Check-in/checkout status,\n\n+Promotion history – reward points – risk level.\n\n+NFT becomes e-ticket + receipt + reputation passport.\n\nPrevious projects only create static NFT or on-chain data, without the ability to update metadata according to CIP-68.\n\n**3\\. CVC Reputation – The first time to integrate reputation score into accommodation tourism**\n\n**Almost no proposal has included a Reputation Score system based on travel behavior\\. CVC in HOTEL NFT evaluates reliability based on:**\n\n+Cancellation history,\n\n+Payment,\n\n+Check-in time,\n\n+Disputes,\n\n+Transaction completion rate.\n\nThis score directly affects:\n\n+Discount level,\n\n+Flexible cancellation rights,\n\n+Deposit level,\n\n+Room/voucher priority.\n\n→ This is a mechanism to create positive incentives, reduce risks from bad-behavior guests - something that no proposal in Catalyst has implemented.\n\n**4\\. Automation &amp; Smart Contract Booking \\- superior automation**\n\n**Not just stopping at &quot;escrow payment&quot; like the old model, but:**\n\n+Smart contract self-builds metadata → mints NFT → updates status;\n\n+Automatically processes payments, refunds, penalty terms;\n\n+Automated onboarding with DID;\n\n+Stores booking history across multiple hotels.\n\nThis level of automation turns booking into an on-chain pipeline, not just a single transaction.\n\n**5\\. Scalability – multi\\-chain services**\n\nWith AI + DID + CIP-68 architecture, HOTEL NFT can become:\n\n+A data standard layer for the entire hotel industry on Cardano;\n\n+A tool to help hotels reduce marketing costs;\n\n+A cross-ecosystem loyalty platform;\n\n+An on-chain database that generates real transaction growth.\n\n**Uniqueness of the Proposal:**\n\nHOTEL NFT is not just another booking platform. We solve the above problems by combining the power of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the unique Cardano Blockchain technology (CIP-68). Here are the main differentiating advantages:\n\n**AI\\-Driven Personalization:** Instead of just a search engine, Hotel NFT acts as a &quot;Virtual Travel Assistant&quot;. Our AI analyzes behavior, preferences, history and budget to proactively suggest the most optimal room and itinerary options, helping users save time and make more accurate decisions.\n\nDynamic Booking NFT (CIP-68) - The &quot;Ticket&quot; Revolution: This is the most unique point. Other systems use electronic tickets (emails) or static NFTs (just images). We use Cardano's CIP-68 token standard to create &quot;living&quot; and updateable NFTs (Updateable Metadata).\n\n**Differentiating benefits: **This NFT is a flexible digital record. It automatically updates the status from **&quot;Booked&quot; \\-&gt; &quot;Checked in&quot; \\-&gt; &quot;Completed&quot;**. More importantly, it stores the user's reputation history right on the NFT itself after each trip, creating long-term cumulative value that legacy systems cannot do.\n\n**Seamless Web3 experience for real services: **Combining AI (to simplify selection) and ADA payments via Smart Contract (to ensure safety and reduce fees), Hotel NFTs bring a truly efficient, transparent and trustworthy RWA booking experience on Cardano.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*We have confirmed pilot participation from 2 hotels, enabling real booking transactions on Cardano testnet\\. This ensures real adoption, real users, and verifiable on\\-chain impact, increasing the value delivered to the ecosystem\\.**\n\nInformation about the hotel chain that will conduct a trial run:\n\n**Xing Ocean Vung Tau:**\n\n[https://www\\.facebook\\.com/xingoceanhomestayvungtau?from\\_xma\\_click=xma\\_web\\_url&amp;xma\\_click\\_id=F5843D91\\-A13D\\-4D75\\-A911\\-98C8F2F0F0A8&amp;tam\\_xma\\_content\\_type=0&amp;is\\_fb\\_content=true&amp;forward=false&amp;ts=1764045399745](https://www.facebook.com/xingoceanhomestayvungtau?from_xma_click=xma_web_url&xma_click_id=F5843D91-A13D-4D75-A911-98C8F2F0F0A8&tam_xma_content_type=0&is_fb_content=true&forward=false&ts=1764045399745)\n\n**Xing City Hotel Da Lat:**\n\n[https://www\\.facebook\\.com/profile\\.php?id=61555537432193&amp;from\\_xma\\_click=xma\\_web\\_url&amp;xma\\_click\\_id=5BE42DAD\\-8FF4\\-4403\\-B798\\-892CC4B049AB&amp;tam\\_xma\\_content\\_type=0&amp;is\\_fb\\_content=true&amp;forward=false&amp;ts=1764045700263](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61555537432193&from_xma_click=xma_web_url&xma_click_id=5BE42DAD-8FF4-4403-B798-892CC4B049AB&tam_xma_content_type=0&is_fb_content=true&forward=false&ts=1764045700263)","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Capabilities & Feasibility","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

With the experience of operating real-life financial models, we have had objective views as well as general assessments through the process of operating these models. From there, we can exploit all the advantages and disadvantages of the difficulties, challenges and barriers. With a practical approach, our team has built and designed the idea for this proposed model to optimally exploit the advantages of real-life models as well as handle as thoroughly as possible the risk factors in financial models with the technological solutions that Cardano brings.\n\n\n\n-Our development team consists of developers with a solid grasp of basic and advanced knowledge of blockchain technology, programming, AI data analysis, and a special focus on the Cardano ecosystem. With practical experience through the positions of vCR, Moderator and many contributions to many funds from Catalyst in the past to the present, we have a deep insight into the Cardano ecosystem as well as the blockchain generations that exist and develop in the market, from which we can build highly effective proposals for the community as well as bring real values ​​to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n\n\n-With extensive skills and experience in operating business and financial models, combined with the ability to analyze, program, apply technology through practical experiences and in-depth assessments from experts who accompany us, this will be the basis for us to be able to commit to the capacity to implement this project.\n\n\n\n**\\*Risk Mitigation Plan:**\n\n**1\\. Technical & Smart Contract Risks**\n\n**Risks:**\n\nSmart contracts that process bookings, escrow payments, or update NFT-CIP68 may have logic errors (wrong status, wrong metadata updates, wrong refund conditions).\n\n**Solution:**\n\nApply property-based testing, test cases that simulate the entire booking lifecycle: booking, payment, check-in/check-out, cancellation.\n\nInternal peer-review and code audit by Plutus/Aiken experts before mainnet.\n\nDeploy a long testnet phase, with simulated user data + pilot community to detect errors before public announcement.\n\nUse reference scripts (CIP-33) + inline datum (CIP-32) to reduce the risk of incorrect operations.\n\n\n\n**2\\. AI Engine & Data Integrity Risks**\n\n**Risks:**\n\nAI system misanalyzes user needs, suggests incorrect rooms or creates inconsistent metadata → affects the experience and quality of NFT booking.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nApply AI Validation Layer: check consistency, limit errors and re-validate before sending via Metadata Builder.\n\nStore suggested configuration (AI audit log) for analysis and adjustment.\n\nAllow users to re-confirm all information before signing on-chain transactions.\n\nGradually fine-tuning according to actual user behavior data.\n\n\n\n**3\\. Payment Escrow & Blockchain Settlement Risks**\n\n**Risks:**\n\nTransaction errors, incomplete payments, failed NFT mints or escrow does not lock the correct amount of ADA.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTransaction-retry mechanism on the frontend when the Cardano network is crowded.\n\nAuto-verify: if escrow lock fails → cancel transaction and do not mint NFT.\n\n\n\nLog all tx-hash for easy reconciliation between guests and hotels.\n\n\n\n**4\\. External Data Risks**\n\n**Risks:**\n\nRoom price or availability data is not synchronized between backend and hotel → leading to incorrect booking.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nUse dual-validation between Hotel DB and partner hotel API.\n\nTemporary cache 30–60s to limit race-condition.\n\nWhen data changes during the transaction → AI Router asks user to reconfirm.\n\nIf API does not respond → system switches user to \"Manual Verify\" mode.\n\n\n\n**5\\. Identity & Reputation Risks \\(DID \\+ CVC\\)**\n\n**Risks:**\n\nDID cannot be authenticated, user does not have reputation history, incorrect reputation data affects discount/promotion.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nAdd fallback: if DID is not working → use local-wallet identity + email/pin authentication.\n\nCVC is recorded on-chain and reviewed periodically to avoid bias.\n\nDo not use CVC for high-risk financial decisions (no credit-scoring), only use for incentives/priorities.\n\n\n\n**6\\. Legal & Regulatory Risks**\n\n**Risks:**\n\nSome countries have strict legal frameworks for tokens, NFTs or international booking services.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nHOTEL-NFT operates decentralized – non-custodial, does not hold money on behalf of users.\n\nNFT is a booking certificate, has no financial or investment functions.\n\nConsult legal advice in key markets before deploying widely.\n\nPersonal data is GDPR compliant and regional privacy standards.\n\n\n\n**7\\. User Adoption & Usability Risks**\n\n**Risks:**\n\nInternet/Web2 users have difficulty getting familiar with blockchain wallets, NFT bookings, or on-chain operations.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nProvide video tutorials, testnet sandboxes for beginners.\n\nUI/UX is step-by-step, with little technical jargon.\n\nEnable bookings in “Guest Mode,” requiring only wallet signing at the end.\n\n\n\n**8\\. Delivery & Milestone Risks**\n\n**Risks:**\n\nDeployment progress is slow due to the relatively complex AI + blockchain workload.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nEach Milestone is broken down into verifiable deliverables.\n\nPublished GitHub repo, tx-hash, diagram, and weekly progress.\n\nOptimize the process with CICD, unit testing, and a dashboard to track dev progress.\n\n\n\n**9\\. Infrastructure & Operations Risks**\n\n**Risks:**\n\nServer congestion, storage errors, or downtime can cause the system to become unstable.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nMulti-zone cloud deployment.\n\nPeriodic backup of DB + IPFS pinning service.\n\nAuto-scaling and load-balancer to maintain service speed during peak traffic.\n\n\n\n**\\*\\*\\*We will conduct a pilot deployment on 2 facilities Xing Ocean & Xing Hotel in VietNam: Two hotel partners will join the pilot test, ensuring real\\-world validation of booking flows, escrow conditions, check\\-in/out signatures, and NFT CIP\\-68 updates\\.

Summary of project value for money:**\n\nThe human resource cost for the HOTEL NFT project is built on the average salary of programmers and technology experts in Vietnam, ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 USD per month for senior roles in the fields of blockchain, AI and full-stack. This is a cost level that has been assessed by experts and is considered appropriate, competitive and reflects the complexity of the project. Using the unit price of human resources in Vietnam also allows us to deploy a highly complete product with an optimal budget, demonstrating responsibility and commitment to using Catalyst capital in a transparent and efficient manner.\n\nThe project's budget not only covers the development team but also includes essential investments in infrastructure, platform design, AI booking engine, NFT CIP-68 metadata and testing - auditing process to ensure the safety and reliability of the system. In addition, the project also plans to cooperate with experienced experts in the field of blockchain and tourism products to ensure the highest quality. All of these expenses directly serve the goal of building a decentralized booking platform that operates smoothly, transparently and can expand to the international market.\n\nThe value of the capital is clearly demonstrated in the ability to transform a very familiar model in life - hotel booking - into a practical application of blockchain. HOTEL NFT not only replaces the traditional booking process with a transparent and automated escrow system using smart contracts, but also incorporates AI to optimize the experience, and applies NFT CIP-68 to represent each room, room price and dynamic attributes. All of these factors contribute to bringing depth and practical application to the Cardano ecosystem, opening up new use cases beyond the scope of purely financial models such as lending/borrowing that are already familiar. The project aims to create a more dynamic consumer space for the ecosystem, contributing to important indicators such as transaction volume, real users, TVL, network fee revenue - factors that are vital to the long-term development of Cardano.\n\nHOTEL NFT also brings benefits not only on a technical level but also has the ability to attract a large number of Web2 and Web3 users from the travel market. The tourism industry is one of the sectors with high transaction volume and high frequency of repetition, and building an on-chain booking model can scale to hundreds of millions of potential users. As the scale of users and transactions increases, the demand for ADA in payment, staking, room management and AI payment automation also increases, contributing to the value and stability of ADA.\n\nSince the price of ADA can fluctuate during the development period, the project has prepared flexible plans to ensure progress. In case ADA drops sharply, we can activate reserve funds from partners and supporting organizations to ensure the implementation process is not interrupted. On the contrary, if ADA increases beyond expectations, the difference will be reinvested in the project, prioritizing advanced items such as extended external code audit, data analysis dashboard, improved AI recommendation engine, multi-language expansion and group hotel management. This makes the platform not only more complete but also ready for the next steps of development after the mainnet launch.","sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Self-Assessment","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Self-Assessment Checklist","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that evidence of prior research, whitepaper, design, or proof-of-concept is provided.","description":"Foundational Work:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes ecosystem research and uses the findings to either (a) justify its uniqueness over existing solutions or (b) demonstrate the value of its novel approach.","description":"Ecosystem Value Proposition:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal demonstrates technical capability via verifiable in-house talent or a confirmed development partner (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, etc.)","description":"Builder Credentials:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposer and all team members are in good standing with prior Catalyst projects.","description":"Catalyst Standing:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal clearly defines the problem and the value of the on-chain utility.","description":"Problem & Use Case:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the primary goal of the proposal is a working prototype deployed on at least a Cardano testnet.","description":"Tangible Prototype:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal outlines a credible and clear technical plan and architecture.","description":"Technical Approach:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget and timeline (≤ 12 months) are realistic for the proposed work.","description":"Realistic Scope:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the proposal includes a community engagement and feedback plan to amplify prototype adoption with the Cardano ecosystem.","description":"Community Engagement:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I confirm that the budget is for future development only; excludes retroactive funding, incentives, giveaways, re-granting, or sub-treasuries.","description":"Budget Compliance:","format":null,"answer":true,"sub_fields":null}]}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/segment","title":"Required Acknowledgements","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Ongoing Projects","description":null,"format":null,"answer":{"projects":[],"has_ongoing_projects":false},"sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Consent & Confirmation","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/agreementConfirmation","title":"I Agree","description":"I confirm that I have read, understand and shall adhere to the [Project Catalyst Platform Terms of Use](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-terms-of-use), [Project Catalyst Platform Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/project-catalyst-platform-privacy-policy), [Terms & Conditions](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions), [Fund Rules](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/fund-rules), [Privacy Policy](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund/fund-basics/project-catalyst-terms-and-conditions/catalyst-fc-privacy-policy).

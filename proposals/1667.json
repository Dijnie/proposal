toolkit tailored specifically for Cardano’s DeFi and governance verticals—addressing a critical gap not fully covered by existing solutions.\n\n\n\nUnlike previous on-chain analytics or visualization projects that mostly target end-users or provide raw data APIs, this toolkit offers:\n\n\n\nStandardized, opinionated metric schemas that directly align with common developer use cases, enabling faster integration and iteration for dApps without reinventing ETL processes.\n\n\n\nModular, open-source ETL pipelines designed to transform raw blockchain data from Cardano-specific indexers into actionable KPIs, bridging the gap between data sources and developer needs.\n\n\n\nA lean prototype scope manageable by a solo developer, emphasizing rapid delivery and practical adoption rather than broad, enterprise-scale dashboards or tools.\n\n\n\nStrong focus on supporting not just DeFi analytics but also governance and Catalyst engagement metrics, facilitating better decision-making and transparency for on-chain voting and DAO participation.\n\n\n\nThis approach improves upon and builds on prior work by shifting the target from generic dashboards or raw data provision to a reusable, extensible developer toolkit that accelerates Cardano ecosystem growth through better data accessibility, modular design, and practical developer tooling.\n\n\n\nIt uniquely blends data engineering expertise with blockchain-specific nuances, tailored for the Cardano community’s needs, providing clear utility and scalability potential beyond existing fragmented tools.​","sub_fields":null},{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.","description":"Please

processes it into standardized metrics tailored for DeFi and governance use cases, and exposes these metrics through a simple REST API and a lightweight web dashboard.\n\n\n\nKey demo features include:\n\n\n\nIngesting Cardano testnet data and computing core KPIs like active DeFi users, transaction volumes per wallet, and governance participation scores.\n\n\n\nA modular schema design enabling easy extension and adaptation for other Cardano verticals.\n\n\n\nAn intuitive UI for querying and visualizing metrics, enabling developers and early adopters to validate data accuracy and utility.\n\n\n\nThe prototype will be deployed on a public Cardano testnet environment and hosted on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS or a decentralized hosting service) with open access to the API and dashboard URLs documented in the project repository.\n\n\n\nOpen-source code, documentation, and deployment instructions will be available on GitHub, encouraging community testing, feedback, and

lacking reusable, opinionated data pipelines and metric definitions, which leads to duplicated work and slow development cycles. By providing prebuilt, extendable ETL pipelines and specialized metric packs, the solution accelerates data access and insight generation for developers.\n\n\n\nCompared to large, enterprise-grade analytics platforms that often serve institutional users or end-user dashboards, this toolkit uniquely targets developers, enabling them to quickly integrate standardized on-chain insights directly into their dApps and governance tooling without reinventing data processing layers.\n\n\n\nThis approach promotes faster iteration, better decision-making, and increased on-chain activity within the Cardano ecosystem by empowering builders with reliable, modular, and open infrastructure tailored for the chain’s unique data characteristics.","sub_fields":null}]},{"ref":"#/definitions/section","title":"Impact","description":null,"format":null,"answer":null,"sub_fields":[{"ref":"#/definitions/multiLineTextEntryMarkdown","title":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","description":"Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community","format":null,"answer":"The project will have a positive impact on the wider Cardano community by significantly lowering barriers for dApp developers and governance teams to access, analyze, and act upon on-chain data.

Increased data transparency and consistent metrics also foster trust and ecosystem collaboration.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, by being open source, the project encourages community contributions and continuous improvement, strengthening Cardano’s data infrastructure ecosystem long-term.

Then, I will develop core KPI calculations early to confirm that meaningful metrics can be derived. I will deploy a simple API and dashboard prototype for developer feedback and iterate quickly based on community input gathered via GitHub and Cardano forums.\n\n\n\nThis phased approach allows me to identify and address technical challenges early, maintain transparency, and demonstrate steady progress through open-source deliverables and milestone reporting.

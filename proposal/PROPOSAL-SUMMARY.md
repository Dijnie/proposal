## Proposal Highlights

### Compelling Copy (from Copywriter Analysis)

**Title:** `Production-Ready CIP68: Power Tickets, Certs & Memberships`
- Emphasizes production-ready (vs proof-of-concept)
- Highlights real-world use cases (tickets, certificates, memberships)
- 58 chars - maximizes information density

**Problem:** `Event organizers need anti-counterfeit NFT tickets. Universities want tamper-proof certificates. But CIP68 is too complex, and no developer API exists for integration into platforms.`
- Concrete use cases (events, universities)
- Dual pain points (complexity + no API)
- 182 chars

**Solution:** `Production-grade CIP68 platform: no-code dashboard for non-technical users + REST API/SDK for developers. Security audited. Open-source. Optimized for tickets, certs, memberships.`
- Dual-audience (no-code + API)
- Trust signals (security audited, open-source)
- 179 chars

### Key Differentiators

1. **Working Prototype** - Not vaporware [PLACEHOLDER: Provide evidence]
2. **Production-Grade** - Security audit, SLA, uptime guarantees
3. **Dual-Audience** - No-code UI + Developer API/SDK (2x market)
4. **Vertical Optimization** - Tickets, certificates, memberships
5. **Open-Source** - Apache 2.0 (community public good)

### Competitive Advantages

**vs Fund12 CIP68 Project (₳87,610):**
- Production-ready (security audit, SLA) vs proof-of-concept
- Dual-audience (API + UI) vs UI-only
- 45% budget increase for 200%+ scope increase

**vs NMKR:**
- Open-source (Apache 2.0) vs proprietary
- Developer API/SDK vs no CIP68 API
- Cardano-native vs multi-chain dilution

**vs JPG.store:**
- Creation tools vs marketplace-only
- Dynamic NFTs (CIP68) vs static (CIP25)

Building on HTlabs' proven Cardano development track record, Polyhydra delivers a production-ready Discord gaming experience that seamlessly bridges Web2 gamers to Cardano via Hydra.

### Early User Interest & Market Validation

Our concept and preliminary research have already identified strong demand channels:

* **Cardano2VN Network:** Access to **500+ Vietnamese Cardano community members** for immediate beta testing and feedback loops.
* **Gaming Community Reach:** Direct access to 3 active Discord gaming servers (totaling 2,000+ members) ready to pilot the Activity.
* **Stake Pool Operators:** Strong relationships with VILAI and HADA stake pools, providing a direct connection to delegators interested in GameFi engagement.

**Target early adopters identified through community engagement:**
* **Web3 Newcomers:** Discord users curious about crypto but deterred by wallet complexity (solved by our "invisible" UTXO.dev integration).
* **DAO Communities:** Cardano DAOs on Discord seeking social activities to increase member engagement.
* **GameFi Enthusiasts:** Players looking for "Provably Fair" gaming mechanics that transparently prevent cheating.

### Expertise and Experience

HTlabs demonstrates deep Cardano expertise through multiple successful Catalyst projects and live production deployments:

**Key Projects:**
* **Learning Management System:** Production LMS at [lms.cardano2vn.io](https://lms.cardano2vn.io)
* **Free Native Minting Tool (CIP25):** Live at [cardano-tool.vercel.app](https://cardano-tool.vercel.app)
* **Complete Aiken Course:** Fund 11 project - [Project Link](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/11/cardano-open-ecosystem/the-complete-aiken-course-cardano-from-zero-to-expert)
* **Open Source CIP68 Generator:** Fund 12 project - [Project Link](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/12/cardano-use-cases-concept/open-source-dynamic-assets-tokennft-generator-cip68)
    * *Relevance:* Demonstrates our ability to handle complex token standards and metadata, which is crucial for Polyhydra's game assets.
* **Study Guide for Marlowe:** Fund 10 project - [Project Link](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/10/f10-startups-and-onboarding-for-students/study-guide-for-marlow)

**Technical Competency for Polyhydra:**
* **Game Stack:** Proficient in **Phaser 3** (Client) and **Colyseus** (Multiplayer Server) on **NestJS**, ensuring a smooth, real-time gaming experience.
* **Blockchain Stack:** Expert knowledge of **Hydra** (State Channels) for scaling and **Aiken** for smart contract logic.
* **Additional projects:** Cardano App Development Course, IoT Blockchain Templates, Dualtarget DeFi platform. Full portfolio: [https://www.htlabs.xyz/projects](https://www.htlabs.xyz/projects)

### Verification of Approach

* **Testnet Validation:** Deploy the game logic and Hydra Head manager on the preview testnet. We will confirm:
    * Hydra Head open/close lifecycles.
    * Turn-based state synchronization latency (<200ms).
    * Provably Fair VRF (Verifiable Random Function) logic correctness.
    * UTXO.dev wallet integration within the Discord iframe environment.
* **Open Beta Testing:** **50+ early adopters** playing full game sessions on testnet. We will collect quantitative metrics (game completion rates, disconnect frequency) and qualitative feedback to refine the UI/UX.
* **Progress Tracking:** Transparent KPI reporting: Game uptime >99.5%, Turn transaction success >99%, Average cost per game <0.1 ADA. Monthly reports on Cardano Forum/GitHub with on-chain evidence (TXIDs of game settlements).

### Fund Management

* **Monthly Budget Reports:** Detailed expenditure breakdowns by category (development, infrastructure, design) with line-item justification submitted to Catalyst monthly.
* **Auditable Invoices:** All third-party invoices (VPS hosting, Discord developer fees, cloud services) documented and archived for Catalyst review.
* **Milestone-Based Disbursements:** Funds released only upon verified deliverables: KPI reports, on-chain evidence (Hydra settlement TXIDs), GitHub code releases, and video demonstrations. Payment after Catalyst reviewer acceptance.

### Why We're Best Suited

* **Proven Catalyst Delivery:** Successful completion of Fund 10, 11, 12, and 13 projects demonstrates our rigorous milestone management and accountability.
* **Full-Stack GameFi Capability:** Unlike teams that specialize only in web or only in blockchain, we bridge the gap. We possess the specific stack required: **React/Next.js** (Frontend), **Phaser/Colyseus** (Game Logic), and **Hydra/Aiken** (Blockchain Settlement).
* **Community Trust:** We maintain a reputation for transparent reporting and open-source contributions. Our local presence (Vietnam) allows us to leverage a highly engaged user base for rapid testing and iteration.
* **Hydra Pioneers:** We are among the few teams actively implementing Hydra for consumer-facing applications, moving beyond theoretical research to practical utility.

### Project Timeline Clarification

The **6-month timeline** features 4 major milestones with completion months listed. Work is continuous throughout:

* **Months 1-2:** Architecture & Hydra Setup (Milestone 1 completion)
* **Months 3-4:** Game Development & Wallet Integration (Milestone 2 completion)
* **Month 5:** VRF Implementation & Beta Launch (Milestone 3 completion)
* **Month 6:** Production Launch & Close-Out (Milestone 4 completion)

No gaps in development - milestones represent completion dates, not start dates. The team works continuously across all 6 months with overlapping workstreams (e.g., Frontend and Smart Contract development happen in parallel).

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/htlabs-xyz/cip68generator
Status: Core CIP-68 validators completed and tested on preprod testnet
Prototype demonstrates: Basic mint/burn operations, reference NFT + user token architecture, metadata handling
Proteus builds upon this foundation by adding: Production-grade features, automation engine, developer API, no-code dashboard, template library, and enterprise capabilities
Additional projects include Cardano App Development Course, IoT Blockchain Templates, Dualtarget DeFi platform, Cardano Hackathons, and Vietnam NFT Exchange. Full portfolio: https://www.htlabs.xyz/projects
Verification of Approach
Testnet Validation: Deploy platform and smart contracts on preprod testnet confirming performance (latency, throughput, gas optimization) and CIP-68 compliance. All contracts publicly verifiable on blockchain explorers.
Open Beta Testing: 50-100 early adopters creating testnet collections, providing quantitative metrics (completion rates, error rates) and feedback to refine UX/documentation. Issues tracked via public GitHub.
Progress Tracking: Transparent KPI reporting: API response &lt;200ms, transaction success &gt;99%, uptime &gt;99.5%, user mint time &lt;30min, beta completion &gt;90%. Monthly reports on Cardano Forum/GitHub with on-chain evidence (TXIDs).
Fund Management
Monthly Budget Reports: Detailed expenditure breakdowns by category (salaries, cloud services, audit) with line-item justification submitted to Catalyst monthly.
Auditable Invoices: All third-party invoices (AWS, Cloudflare, Blockfrost, auditors) documented and archived for Catalyst review with full categorization.
Milestone-Based Disbursements: Funds released only upon verified deliverables: KPI reports, on-chain evidence (TXID lists), GitHub releases, video demonstrations. Payment after Catalyst reviewer acceptance.
Why We're Best Suited
Proven Catalyst Delivery: Successful completion of Fund 10, 11, 12, 13 projects demonstrates milestone management and accountability.
CIP-68 Expertise: Fund 12 CIP68 Generator project means core challenges already solved—we're productizing proven technology, not experimenting.
Full-Stack Capability: Portfolio spans smart contracts (Aiken, Marlowe, Plutus), web development (LMS, tools), and production infrastructure—delivering complete integrated systems.
Community Trust: Transparent reporting, open-source contributions, and consistent delivery across multiple projects. Track record verifiable through live products and Catalyst history.

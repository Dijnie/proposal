## Feasibility

Building on HTlabs' proven Cardano development track record, Proteus delivers production-ready CIP-68 infrastructure matching Web2 developer experience standards.

### Expertise and Experience

HTlabs demonstrates deep Cardano expertise through multiple successful Catalyst projects and live production deployments:

**Key Projects:**

- **Learning Management System:** Production LMS at https://lms.cardano2vn.io
- **Free Native Minting Tool (CIP25):** Live at https://cardano-tool.vercel.app
- **Complete Aiken Course:** Fund 11 project - https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/11/cardano-open-ecosystem/the-complete-aiken-course-cardano-from-zero-to-expert
- **Study Guide for Marlowe:** Fund 10 project - https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/10/f10-startups-and-onboarding-for-students/study-guide-for-marlow
- **Dualtarget for ADA-Holders – Staking optimization platform:** Fund 11 project - https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/11/cardano-use-cases-concept/dualtarget-for-ada-holders-staking-and-increasing-assets-with-a-decentralized-automated-trading-bot
- **Real-time LAMP IoT-Blockchain Prototype – Medical diagnostic integration:** Fund 11 project - https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/11/cardano-use-cases-concept/researching-and-manufacturing-a-point-of-care-real-time-lamp-prototype-with-iot-and-blockchain-integration-for-rapid-disease-analysis
- **Open Source Dynamic Assets Generator (CIP68) – Foundation for this proposal:** Fund 12 project - https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/12/cardano-use-cases-concept/open-source-dynamic-assets-tokennft-generator-cip68 
- **Open Source CIP68 Generator:** Fund 12 project - https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/12/cardano-use-cases-concept/open-source-dynamic-assets-tokennft-generator-cip68 (Direct predecessor)
  - GitHub Repository: https://github.com/htlabs-xyz/cip68generator
  - Status: Core CIP-68 validators completed and tested on preprod testnet
  - Prototype demonstrates: Basic mint/burn operations, reference NFT + user token architecture, metadata handling
  - Proteus builds upon this foundation by adding: Production-grade features, automation engine, developer API, no-code dashboard, template library, and enterprise capabilities

Additional projects include Cardano App Development Course, IoT Blockchain Templates, Dualtarget DeFi platform, Cardano Hackathons, and Vietnam NFT Exchange. Full portfolio: https://www.htlabs.xyz/projects

### Verification of Approach

- **Testnet Validation:** Deploy platform and smart contracts on preprod testnet confirming performance (latency, throughput, gas optimization) and CIP-68 compliance. All contracts publicly verifiable on blockchain explorers.
- **Open Beta Testing:** 50-100 early adopters creating testnet collections, providing quantitative metrics (completion rates, error rates) and feedback to refine UX/documentation. Issues tracked via public GitHub.
- **Progress Tracking:** Transparent KPI reporting: API response <200ms, transaction success >99%, uptime >99.5%, user mint time <30min, beta completion >90%. Monthly reports on Cardano Forum/GitHub with on-chain evidence (TXIDs).

### Fund Management

- **Monthly Budget Reports:** Detailed expenditure breakdowns by category (salaries, cloud services, audit) with line-item justification submitted to Catalyst monthly.
- **Auditable Invoices:** All third-party invoices (AWS, Cloudflare, Blockfrost, auditors) documented and archived for Catalyst review with full categorization.
- **Milestone-Based Disbursements:** Funds released only upon verified deliverables: KPI reports, on-chain evidence (TXID lists), GitHub releases, video demonstrations. Payment after Catalyst reviewer acceptance.

### Why We're Best Suited

- **Proven Catalyst Delivery:** Successful completion of Fund 10, 11, 12, 13 projects demonstrates milestone management and accountability.
- **CIP-68 Expertise:** Fund 12 CIP68 Generator project means core challenges already solved—we're productizing proven technology, not experimenting.
- **Full-Stack Capability:** Portfolio spans smart contracts (Aiken, Marlowe, Plutus), web development (LMS, tools), and production infrastructure—delivering complete integrated systems.
- **Community Trust:** Transparent reporting, open-source contributions, and consistent delivery across multiple projects. Track record verifiable through live products and Catalyst history.

**Key Insight:** Fund 12 validated technical feasibility and proved CIP-68 works. Proteus transforms that prototype into production infrastructure enabling ecosystem-wide adoption with enterprise features, comprehensive automation, and developer-friendly tooling that matches Web2 standards.

### Project Timeline Clarification

The 8-month timeline features 6 major milestones with completion months listed. Work is continuous throughout:

- **Month 1:** Architecture & Planning (Milestone 1 completion)
- **Month 2:** Smart Contract Development (Milestone 2 completion)
- **Months 3-4:** Backend API Development (Milestone 3 completes Month 4)
- **Months 5-6:** Dashboard & User Interface (Milestone 4 completes Month 6)
- **Month 7:** Testing & Security Audit (Milestone 5 completion)
- **Month 8:** Mainnet Launch & Close-Out (Milestone 6 completion)

No gaps in development - milestones represent completion dates, not start dates. Team works continuously across all 8 months with overlapping workstreams.

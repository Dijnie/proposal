# Copywriter Brief: Vietnam Cardano Startup Hackathon 2026

## Project Context
Vietnam Cardano Startup Hackathon 2026 - First major Cardano hackathon targeting Vietnam/Southeast Asia startup ecosystem with deep university partnerships.

## Fund15 Details
- **Category**: Cardano Open (Ecosystem)
- **Budget**: 60,000 ADA (~$30k USD)
- **Duration**: 4-6 months

## Key Information
- **Past Track Record**: Successfully organized hackathon with 50-100 participants, 10-20 projects
- **University Partners**: VNU, HCMUT, FPT University, HUST (all 4 committed)
- **Target Metrics**: 150-200 participants, 25-35 projects, 5-10 on-chain deployments
- **Unique Angle**: First large-scale Cardano hackathon in Vietnam with comprehensive university partnerships
- **Team**: 3-5 person experienced team (event management, marketing, operations)

## Target Audience
Cardano community voters who value:
- Ecosystem growth in emerging markets (SEA)
- University talent pipeline development
- Grassroots community building
- Verifiable on-chain outcomes
- Proven team capability

## Deliverables Needed

### 1. Title (≤60 characters)
Create 3 compelling variations that:
- Clearly communicate "Vietnam + Cardano + Hackathon"
- Express innovation/impact
- Stop the scroll in voting app
- Avoid generic marketing speak

### 2. Problem Statement (≤200 characters including spaces)
Create 3 variations that:
- Highlight urgent problem: Vietnam/SEA lacks Cardano developer talent and startup ecosystem
- Make pain point clear to voters
- Connect to Cardano's global adoption goals
- Use specific, concrete language

### 3. Solution Overview (≤200 characters including spaces)
Create 3 variations that:
- Concrete deliverable: "We will run X event with Y universities producing Z outcomes"
- Clear benefit: pipeline of developers/startups entering Cardano ecosystem
- Connect problem → solution
- Emphasize verifiable outcomes (participants, projects, on-chain deployments)

## Constraints
- Character limits are HARD limits (must count)
- Be clear and specific, avoid vague claims
- Focus on voter value: "Why fund this?"
- Emphasize: proven track record + university partnerships + measurable outcomes

## Psychology Notes
- Vietnam/SEA = untapped market opportunity (growth angle)
- University partnerships = sustainable talent pipeline (long-term value)
- Past success = low risk (proven capability)
- On-chain metrics = verifiable impact (accountability)

Please provide 3 variations for each (title, problem, solution) with character counts and brief explanation of why each variation works from a conversion/persuasion perspective.

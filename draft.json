        "solution": "**Current Problem**\n\nCardano's Hydra Heads enable high-throughput, low-latency Layer-2 transactions, but practical adoption remains limited due to fragmented, language-specific developer tools.\n\nChallenges for C Developers:\n\n1. Protocol Complexity\n- Hydra messages (commit, fanout, snapshot, rollback) require precise handling\n- Mismanaging messages leads to failed transactions or incorrect head states\n- No abstraction layer simplifies this for C environments\n\n2. Lack of C Tooling\n- Existing SDKs focus on Haskell and TypeScript\n- No ready-to-use C library for Hydra Heads\n- IoT and embedded developers have no viable option\n\n3. Testing Barriers\n- No example scripts for Hydra Head workflows\n- No integration testing frameworks in C\n- Experimentation is slow and error-prone\n\n4. Limited Educational Resources\n- Documentation scattered across multiple sources\n- Steep learning curve for new developers\n- No end-to-end examples showing complete workflows\n\nResult: IoT solutions, C-based applications, and gaming projects cannot leverage Cardano's Layer-2 capabilities.\n\n**Solution**\n\nHydra C SDK provides a lightweight, open-source C library with developer-friendly APIs for Hydra Head interaction.\n\nArchitecture (layered design):\n- Application Layer → HydraClient (High-level API)\n- State Layer → HydraState (State Machine)\n- Protocol Layer → HydraJSON (encode/decode)\n- Network Layer → HydraWS (websocket/tls)\n\nKey Features:\n\n1. Reliable Network Communication\n- WebSocket client with automatic reconnection\n- Heartbeat mechanism for connection health\n- Exponential backoff for transient failures\n- TLS support via OpenSSL/mbedTLS\n\n2. Layer-2 Transaction Tools\n- Transaction builder for Hydra Heads\n- UTxO query API\n- Automated transaction submission with retry\n- Commit, fanout, and finalization functions\n\n3. State Management\n- Hydra Head lifecycle state machine\n- Out-of-order message handling\n- Rollback event processing\n- Full event callback system\n\n4. Developer Resources\n- End-to-end demo scripts\n- Prebuilt cross-platform binaries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Ready-to-run examples\n\nTarget Users:\n- IoT developers building blockchain-connected devices\n- Game developers needing fast L2 transactions\n- C/C++ developers working on embedded systems\n- Researchers studying Layer-2 protocols\n\nWhy C?\n- Lightweight footprint for resource-constrained devices\n- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)\n- Easy binding to other languages (Python, Rust, Go)\n- Direct integration with game engines and IoT frameworks\n\n**Reason for Building**\n\n1. Accelerate Layer-2 Adoption - Lower barrier for Hydra development, enable rapid prototyping, increase real-world Cardano L2 usage\n\n2. Empower Non-Traditional Developers - Bring Hydra to IoT engineers, game developers, embedded systems\n\n3. Enable Education - Practical learning environment, bridge theory and implementation\n\n4. Foster Ecosystem Growth - Open-source for community contribution, MIT license for maximum flexibility"
